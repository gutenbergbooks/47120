<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE DEPARTURE OF A HERO</small></h2>


<p>It cannot be truthfully said that Dick Bates
was overwhelmingly surprised when he reached
the railroad station that September morning and
found fully a score of his schoolmates assembled
there. Wally Nourse had let the cat out of the
bag the day before. Wally was one of those well-meaning
but too talkative youths such as we have
all met. But Dick played the game perfectly this
morning, descending from the carriage—Mr.
Bates was one of the very few persons left in
Leonardville who could afford an automobile and
still drove horses—with an expression of questioning
surprise. He realized that too much surprise
would suggest that he knew the assemblage was
there to do him honour; and if, as some said, Dick
was conceited, at least he was always careful not
to seem so.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates handed the lines to Hogan, the coachman,
who had ridden in the back seat surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by Dick’s luggage, and followed his son to the platform
with a satisfied smile on his seamed, good-humoured
countenance. It pleased him that this
younger son of his should be popular and sought
after. To a certain extent he accepted it as a compliment
to himself. Dick was already surrounded
by the little throng of high school boys and girls—for
the gentle sex was well represented, too—and
his father heard him telling them in that pleasant,
rather deep voice of his how unsuspected and undeserved
it all was. Mr. Bates wasn’t deceived,
however. Dick had confided to him on the way
from the house that there might be a few of the
fellows there to see him off. Instead, he chuckled
to himself. “You can’t beat him at the diplomatic
stuff,” he thought proudly. Then his smile faded.
“Wonder if he isn’t a little <em>too</em> good at it!” Then
Doris Ferguson had spied him and was clinging
to his arm and telling him how mean and horrible
he was to let Dick go away and leave them, and the
other girls, seven in all, were chiming in, and
everyone was talking at once. And that pleased
Mr. Bates, too, for he liked Doris and, having no
daughters of his own, wished he had a girl just
like her. He patted her hand and beamed down
at her from his six-foot height.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you take on so, young lady. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
you remember you’ve still got me. Course, I can’t
play one of those half-portion banjos like Dick can,
but I’m just as nice as he is other ways!”</p>

<p>Sumner White had drawn Dick apart. Sumner
was this year’s football captain, and the other
boys, watching and trying to appear not to be, felt
that words of weight and wisdom were being exchanged
over there by the baggage-room door, and
wouldn’t have interrupted for worlds. What Sumner
was saying just then may have contained wisdom,
but certainly wasn’t very weighty.</p>

<p>“If you run across any real good plays or
wrinkles, Dick, I wish you’d put me on, eh? I
guess they play pretty near college football at
Parkinson, and you know how it is here. If Murphy
ever had a new idea he’d drop dead! Of
course I wouldn’t give anything away. You can
trust me to keep mum, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I will, Sum, if I can. But I may not
get near the team, you know. I guess they have a
raft of corking good players at Parkinson,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, pickles!” jeered Sumner. “I guess they
won’t have so many good quarters that you’ll be
passed up! Bet you anything you’ll be playing on
the Parkinson team before you’ve been there a
week! Gee, I sort of wish you weren’t going, Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
It’s leaving us in a beast of a hole. Say, honest,
do you think Rogers could ever learn?”</p>

<p>“I think Sam’s the best we—the best you’ve
got, Sum. All he needs is a whole lot of work. Of
course you can try Littleton if you like, but you
know my opinion of him.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, I know. But Sam’s so blamed dumb!
Gee, you have to use a sledge to knock anything
into—There’s your train, I think. She whistled
down by the crossing. Well, say, Dick old scout,
I sure wish you the best of luck and everything.
You’re going to make us all mighty proud of you,
or I miss my guess! We’ll all be rooting for you,
you know that. Well, guess the others’ll want to
say good-bye. Wish you’d drop me a line some
time, eh? I’ll write, too, when I get a chance.
But you know how it’s going to be this fall, with
a lot of new fellows to break in and Murphy away
more’n half the time, and——”</p>

<p>“Sure, Sum, I know, but you’ll get by all right.
I wish I could be here when you play Norristown,
but I suppose I’ll be busy myself. So long!”</p>

<p>After that there was much confusion. Wade
Jennings shoved a package tied with blue and
white ribbon, the high school colours, into Dick’s
hands and tried to make the presentation speech he
had been practising for two days. But everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
talked at once, the train came thundering in, and
his stammers were drowned in the tumult. Dick
had to shake hands all around, darting across the
platform at the last moment to say good-bye to
Hogan, and then listening to his father’s final instructions
as to tickets and changing at Philadelphia.
A grinning porter took charge of his luggage
and Dick followed him up the car steps and from
the platform smilingly surveyed the laughing
crowd below. Afterwards it came to him that
Wally Nourse had been the only one who had
looked really sorry, that the others were merely
merry and excited! Of course he excepted his
father. Poor old dad had really looked quite down
at the mouth when, pursued by the high school
cheer, the train had pulled out. Tommy Nutting,
true to the last to his rôle of school jester, had
blown kisses from the summit of a baggage truck,
and Doris Ferguson had pretended to wipe tears
from her eyes. The rest was a confused memory.</p>

<p>Dick found his seat in the parlour car and
watched the frayed and tattered hem of Leonardville
disappear: the brick-yards, the carpet factory,
the blocks of monotonous, square, lead-hued
houses of the operatives, the tumble-down quarter
known as Povertyville, and then, at last, the open
country still green and smiling. His last glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was of the slender steeple of the Baptist church,
white above the old elms around it. He changed
his straw hat for a light-weight cap and opened a
magazine he had tossed into his bag at the last
moment. Then, however, his eyes fell on the ribboned
package and he picked it up eagerly. The
next moment he remembered his neighbours up
and down the aisle and so he pretended to suppress
a yawn as he struggled with the entwined
ribbons. When the covering was off he found a
pair of silver-backed military brushes hidden
amidst much rustling white tissue and a folded
sheet of paper. The brushes weren’t half bad,
and although he already had a pair, he made up
his mind to use them. The message read: “To
Richard Corliss Bates from his friends and fellow-members
of the L. H. S. M. C.” Then followed
some thirty names, the complete roster of the
High School Musical Club, and, in a lower corner,
in Wade Jennings’ uncertain writing, the further
message: “There wasn’t time to have them
marked, but they’ll do it the first time you come
home.”</p>

<p>Dick was pleased in a complacent way. The
brushes were nicer, in better taste than he had expected
they would be. Of course he had known
they were coming: trust Wally for that! But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
if Wally hadn’t talked, Dick would have expected
a gift of some sort. He was the sort who got gifts,
not through any effort of his, but because folks
liked him and seemed to want to do things for him.
He never went out of his way to gain popularity.
He didn’t have to. But he enjoyed it thoroughly,
and, having known it for some time, had become to
regard it as his right. Today, the silver brushes
pleased him not because of their value, which, after
all, wasn’t great, but because they stood as a further
tribute to his popularity.</p>

<p>Dick was seventeen, the right height for his
age, slender in a well-muscled, athletic way, and
undeniably good-looking. His features were regular,
with a rather high forehead and a well-cut
straight nose. His eyes were brown, a warm
brown that held a suggestion of red, and matched
his hair. He had a fair complexion with plenty
of healthy colour in the cheeks. It was one of the
few sorrows of his life that he didn’t tan readily,
that he had to go through a beastly period of sunburn
and peeling skin before he could attain a
decent shade of brown. He seemed unaware of
his personal attractions, whether he was or not,
and his smile, which was not the least of them,
won where mere good looks failed. He always
stood high in his class, for he learned easily. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
had a gift for music and could play any instrument
at least passably after a surprisingly short
acquaintance. He had a pleasant speaking voice
and sang an excellent tenor on the school Glee
Club. But it was perhaps in the less polite pursuits
that he excelled. He had a record of ten and
two-fifths for the hundred yards and had done the
two-twenty under twenty-four. He was a fair
high-jumper, usually certain of third place in the
Dual Meet. In the water he was brother to a fish.
He had played baseball one season not at all badly
and could fill in at basket ball if needed. But,
when all is said, Dick’s line was football. He
had played two years on the High School Team
at quarter-back. Last year he had been offered
the captaincy without a dissenting voice and had
refused it, announcing, what he had kept a secret
until then, that he was leaving at the end of the
school year, and nominating Sumner White.
That Sumner was promptly elected was a further
proof of Dick’s popularity, for ordinarily Sumner
would scarcely have been thought of. As a
football player Dick was really brilliant. He had
a collection of fourteen epistles, which he was not
averse to showing to close friends, from as many
preparatory schools and smaller colleges urging
him to consider their advantages to a person of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
scholastic attainments. Parkinson School, however,
was not represented in that collection, perhaps
because Parkinson was too far away for his
fame to have reached it. Dick had chosen Parkinson
for the completion of his preparation for college
only because his brother Stuart had graduated
from there some five years before. Stuart had
talked of Parkinson so much that Dick felt that he
knew the school and that he was certain to like it.
He might have entered two years ago, but had
chosen to remain at the high school until he could
go to the preparatory school with a fair chance of
making the football team. He believed now that
the time had arrived. Although he had belittled
his chances in conversation with Sumner White,
secretly Dick entertained few doubts of his ability
to make the Parkinson team.</p>

<p>He was entering the Third Class and had been
assigned a room in Sohmer Hall. Brother Stuart
had advised Sohmer, since it was the newest of
the dormitory buildings, and Dick had made application
the year before. To his regret, he had not
been able to get a room to himself, but the fact
didn’t trouble him greatly. In fact he recognised
certain advantages accruing from a room-mate.
Who that person was to be he had not yet
learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>His train reached Philadelphia at a few minutes
before eleven and he had just time to buy a
morning paper before the New York Express left.
He didn’t waste much time on the front page of
the journal, soon turning to the football and athletic
news. A hair-breadth connection in New
York put him on the last lap of his journey, and,
after a deliberative meal in the diner and the
perusal of one story in the magazine, it was time
to gather his luggage together. The train slid into
Warne at three-fifty, and Dick, not a little excited
under his appearance of perfect calm, alighted.</p>

<small>“WASHINGTON P. QUIGGLE”</small></h2>


<p>Stuart had instructed him so thoroughly that
Dick knew just which way to turn in order to find
a conveyance to carry him to the school, but Stuart
had spoken of carriages and Dick found nothing
but chugging “flivvers” manned by eager and
noisy youths to whom he hesitated to entrust his
life. Automobiles, he presumed, had arrived since
Stuart’s time. Dick remained so long in doubt
that, almost before he knew it, all but one of the
throbbing taxies had found their loads and gone
rattling off over the cobbles. He made his way
to the remaining conveyance quickly then, but not
so quickly as to reach it first. A boy a year or so
older already had a hand on the door when Dick
arrived.</p>

<p>“Goss, Eddie,” Dick heard the boy say. “And
don’t spare the horses!”</p>

<p>But Eddie, who Dick had earlier decided was
the least attractive of the half-dozen drivers, was
not losing any chances.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Parkinson School? Step right in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The gentleman inside won’t mind. What building,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Sohmer,” answered Dick. And then, to the
occupant: “Mind if I go along?” he asked. “This
seems to be the only taxi left.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. The more the merrier! Besides,”
he continued as the car shot away from the platform
with a jerk, wheeled suddenly to the left
and dashed headlong over the cobbles, “it makes
for economy. They put the fare up last spring.
It would have cost me a half if I’d gone alone. By
the way, are you in a great hurry?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, I am.” He leaned toward the open window
in front. “Take me to Goss first, Eddie,” he
directed.</p>

<p>He was a tall, rather thin and very long-legged
youth with a nose that matched the other specifications,
and a pair of blue-grey eyes that, in spite of
their owner’s grave and serious expression,
seemed to hold a twinkle of amusement or perhaps
of mischief. He had placed a very battered
suit-case before him on the floor of the car and
now put his feet on it, settled to the small of his
back and turned a look of polite inquiry on Dick.</p>

<p>“My name’s Quiggle,” he said, “Washington
P. Quiggle.” He made a feeble motion toward a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pocket. “I haven’t a card with me, I fear. I
have, believe me, no desire to thrust my acquaintance
on you, but since Fate has thrown us together
like this——” He paused apologetically.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Dick. “Very glad to
meet you. My name is Bates.” He smiled.
Rather to his surprise Washington Quiggle didn’t
smile back. Instead, he put his head a bit on
one side and seemed to regard Dick speculatingly.</p>

<p>“Showing the teeth slightly,” he murmured.
At least, that’s what Dick thought he said, but as
there was no sense in the remark, perhaps he was
mistaken.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I speak?” asked Quiggle. “A lamentable
habit of mine, Mr. Bates, unconsciously giving
utterance to my thoughts. A habit inherited
from my grandfather on my mother’s side. Most
annoying at times and likely to lead to an erroneous
impression of my mentality. And speaking of
my grandfather, a most worthy and respected
citizen in spite of the misfortune that overtook
him in his later years: I refer, of course, to the
loss of his mind, accompanied, or should I say
superseded, by homicidal mania; speaking of him,
then, suppose I relieve myself of my portion of
the expenses of this placid journey, thus.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
dug a hand into a trousers pocket and produced a
twenty-five cent piece which he handed to Dick.
“It will save time and—I was about to say money—and
trouble if you will settle with Edward for
us both. I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured Dick. By now he was
rather hoping that Goss Hall would be reached before
his companion’s perfectly evident insanity
took a violent turn! For there was no doubt in
Dick’s mind but that Mr. Washington P. Quiggle
was what in the everyday language of Leonardville
was known as a “nut.” Quiggle had closed
his eyes and appeared to be on the verge of slumber,
and after a moment’s concerned observation
of him Dick turned his gaze to the town through
which the car was speeding. The cobbles had
given place to asphalt and while Quiggle’s choice
of the word “placid” was not entirely justified, at
least the car was running much more quietly and
far more smoothly. There were some decent
looking shops on each side of the street and a
fairly imposing office building occupied one corner
of the street into which the taxi suddenly and
disconcertingly turned. The lurch may have
brought momentary consciousness back to Quiggle,
for his eyes opened and closed and he remarked
quite distinctly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hard a lee! Man the water-butt! Aye, aye,
sir!”</p>

<p>A pleasant wide thoroughfare opened to view
right and left at the end of a block, and Dick
caught sight of attractive houses set back from the
street and lawns and gardens between. Then,
without diminishing it’s twenty-five-miles-an-hour
speed, the taxi dashed between two stone gate
posts and scurried up a gravelled road bisecting a
wide expanse of level turf. Trees grew on each
side, but between them Dick had occasional
glimpses of the school buildings which, for the
most part, were spaced along the further side of
the campus. Parkinson Hall he recognised readily
from the picture in the school catalogue, a white
marble edifice surmounted by a glassed dome, but
which was Sohmer he wasn’t certain. Having
crossed the width of the campus, the taxi swerved
perilously to the right in front of Parkinson and
dashed on until, with a sudden and unexpected application
of the brakes, the driver brought it to a
tottering stand-still before the entrance of a brick
building. The jar aroused Quiggle and he sat up.</p>

<p>“Ah! Home again as we perceive! Back to
the classic shades of our dear old Alma Mater!”
he exclaimed as he opened the door on his side by
the pressure of one bony knee against the handle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and seized his bag. “Mr. Bates, I sincerely trust
that we shall meet again. Should you care to pursue
the acquaintance so—so—dare I say—fortunately
brought about, you have but to inquire of
any resident of this palatial dwelling in order to
learn of my place of abode. I’d tell you the number
of my room were it not that, owing to an inherited
weakness of memory, I cannot at the moment
recall it. Eddie, the gentleman within will
pay your outrageous charge.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know, but——”</p>

<p>“Edward,” interrupted Quiggle sternly, “the
gentleman has my fare and will deliver it to you
with his own. Drive on!”</p>

<p>After a moment of indecision and muttering,
Edward drove on. Looking back through the rear
window of the car, Dick saw Quiggle wave grandly,
beneficently ere, bag in hand, he disappeared into
Goss.</p>

<p>There was another turn, again to the right,
and once more the car stopped. “Here you are,
sir,” announced the driver. “Sohmer Hall.
You’ll excuse me if I don’t take your bag
in for you, but we ain’t allowed to leave the
car.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Dick, emerging.
“Here you are.” He held forth a half-dollar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The driver observed it coldly and made no effort
to take it. “Quit your kiddin’,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all you’ll get,” replied Dick
warmly. “That’s the legal fare.”</p>

<p>“It is, eh? Say, where do you get that stuff?
Listen, kid. The fare’s fifty cents a person,
seventy-five for two. Get me?”</p>

<p>“What! Why, that other fellow said it was—Anyway,
he gave me a quarter for his share of
it!”</p>

<p>The driver nodded wearily. “Sure he would!
That’s him all over. You’re lucky he didn’t stick
you for the whole racket. Come across with another
quarter, young feller!”</p>

<p>Grudgingly, Dick did so. “If you knew Quiggle
was that sort——” he began aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the driver, a grin growing about
his mouth.</p>

<p>“Quiggle. The fellow you left at Goss Hall. I
say, if you knew——”</p>

<p>“His name ain’t Quiggle,” jeered the driver.
“Gee, that’s a peach! Quiggle! What do you
know about that?”</p>

<p>“What is his name then?” demanded Dick
haughtily.</p>

<p>“His name’s—Well, it ought to be Slippery
Simpson, but it ain’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon there was a deafening grinding of
gears, a snort, and the “flivver” swung about on
two wheels and went charging off.</p>

<p>Dick looked after it disgustedly and then, taking
up his suit-case, mounted the steps of Sohmer.</p>

<p>“I’ll Quiggle him when I catch him!” he muttered.
“Fresh chump!”</p>

<p>In consequence of the episode, Dick reached his
room on the second floor decidedly out of sorts.
He didn’t mind being cheated out of twelve or
thirteen cents, but it disgruntled him to be made
a fool of. He wasn’t used to it. At home no one
would have though of attempting such a silly trick
on him. He experienced, for the first time since
leaving Leonardville, a qualm of apprehension.
If Quiggle, or whatever his silly name really was,
was a fair sample of the fellows he was to meet at
Parkinson, the outlook for being treated with the
respect that he was accustomed to was not at all
satisfactory. Unconsciously he had journeyed to
Warne under the impression that his appearance
at school would be hailed with, if not excited acclaim,
at least with measurable satisfaction. And
here the first fellow he had run across had played
a perfectly rotten joke on him! Dick’s dignity
was considerably ruffled.</p>

<p>Number 14 proved to be a corner study, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
on the front. It wasn’t a bad room, Dick decided
a bit patronisingly, and the view from the windows
was satisfactory. On one side he looked across a
bit of the campus and over to the wide street that
was lined with gardens and lawns: Faculty Row it
was called, although Dick didn’t know it then.
From the other window he saw a tree-shaded, asphalt-paved
road and one or two old-fashioned
white dwellings beyond, and a corner of a square
brick building set at a little distance just inside the
grounds. That, unless he was mistaken, was the
Administration Building, and he must go there
shortly and register.</p>

<p>Dick turned to the alcove bedroom divided from
the study by curtains. There were two single
beds there, two dressers and two chairs, and a
single window gave light. Also, on one of the beds
was an open suit-case, its contents tumbling over
onto the white counterpane. One battered end
showed the initials “S. G.” Dick wondered if
the S stood for Sam. Approaching footsteps
in the corridor turned his eyes toward the door,
but the steps stopped at a room across the way.
There followed the sound of a bag dropped to the
floor and then the opposite door banged shut.
Dick, back in the study, viewed it without enthusiasm.
It was smaller than he liked and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
furniture, while there was plenty of it—two small
study tables, each under its own side-light, what
he mentally dubbed a “near-leather” couch, two
easy-chairs and two straight-backed chairs—was
very evidently far from new. There was a faded
blue carpet-rug on the floor and a short window-seat
occupied the embrasure that held the end
window. The original colour-scheme had been
brown and blue, but the deep tan cartridge paper
had faded, as had the alcove curtains and the rug.
Here and there, on the walls, a square or oblong
of a deeper shade showed where a picture had
hung.</p>

<p>Dick had left the hall door ajar and now he was
aware of much noise and bustle throughout the
building. Doors in the various corridors opened
and shut, voices called, someone further along the
hall was singing, while, outside, a taxi chugged
before the entrance. Dick put his hat on and went
out, passing several new arrivals on the way and
exchanging with them swiftly appraising glances.
The Administration Building stood only a few
rods away and Dick’s business was soon attended
to, for only a half-dozen or so were before him.
Having paid his term bill and inscribed his name
on a card that was handed him, he was given a
booklet containing the school regulations and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
information, a receipt for his money and a
ruled card on which to schedule his recitations.
Beside the door was a bulletin board and he paused
to read some of the notices posted there. There
was a reception to new students that evening at
the Principal’s residence, a half-year course in
geometrical drawing would be conducted by Mr.
McCreedy for First and Second Class students
and those wishing to sign on should notify him by
Saturday, Mr. Nolan would not be able to see students
in his advisory capacity until Thursday,
subscriptions to <cite>The Leader</cite> could be left at the
office here or at the room of the publication, and
so on. But the notice that interested Dick most
ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Candidates for the First Football Team should
report on the field, dressed to play, not later than
Wednesday. Attention is called to the school regulation
requiring the candidate to pass a satisfactory
physical examination before joining the
squad.</p>

<p class="right">“Stearns Whipple, Mgr.”</p>
</div>

<p>Outside, Dick pulled the booklet from his pocket
and sought information regarding physical examinations.
He found a whole page on the subject.
It was necessary, it appeared, to go to the Physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Director’s office in the gymnasium and make
application for an appointment. Students failing
to keep appointments promptly were required to
make new ones. There was much more, but that
was sufficient for the present, and Dick made his
way back along the road to the gymnasium. Inside,
he had to take his place in a line of nearly a
dozen boys, and progress toward the wicket, behind
which a youth not much older than Dick supplied
information or made out appointment cards,
was slow. Eventually, though, Dick reached the
window, made known his wants and was given a
slip of pasteboard which informed him that the
Physical Director would see him at five-fifteen on
Wednesday. That was the day after tomorrow.
It looked to Dick as if he could not report for
football until he had been passed by the Physical
Director and could not be passed by the director
until it was too late to report for football! Perhaps,
however, that notice in the Administration
Building didn’t mean quite what it said. He would
ask someone when he found the chance.</p>

<p>With an hour remaining before supper time and
nothing better to do, he wandered across to where
a score of fellows were trotting about the gridiron
or kicking and catching at the further end of it.
That first uninterrupted sight of Parkinson Field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
greatly increased his respect for the school, and
he paused at a corner of the big grand stand and
admired. Nearly twelve acres of level turf
stretched before him. There were three gridirons,
that of the First Team enclosed by a quarter-mile
track, as well as several baseball diamonds and
numerous tennis courts, both dirt and grass. A
handful of onlookers were scattered over the stand
and another handful stood along the side-line. A
stout, round-faced man in an old sweater and a
pair of frayed trousers had “Trainer” written all
over him, and since at the moment he was occupied
only in juggling a football from one hand to the
other, Dick decided to seek information of him.</p>

<p>“My name’s Bates,” announced Dick, “and
I’m going to try for the team, but I understand
that I’ve got to take my physical examination first.
Is that correct?”</p>

<p>Billy Goode viewed him critically before he
answered. Rather to Dick’s surprise the trainer
seemed not at all impressed by what he saw.
“You can report as soon as you like,” he replied
at last, “but you can’t play until you’ve been
o. k.’d, my friend. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Bates,” answered Dick. He had already given
it once, but perhaps the other hadn’t caught it.
“I’m from Leonardville High.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Played, have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” It seemed to Dick that any live, wide-awake
football trainer should have been aware of
the fact. “Yes, I’ve played quite a little.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, you see the manager; he’s
around here somewhere, or he was; he’ll look after
you. Chandler! That’ll do for today. Jog the
track once and go on in.” Billy Goode turned
away to meet the remonstrances of a big, heavily-built
youth who had been catching punts and returning
them a little further along the field, leaving
Dick a trifle ruffled. This was not just the sort
of reception he had expected. Of course, it was
understandable that the Philadelphia papers didn’t
penetrate to Warne, Massachusetts, in which case
the trainer wouldn’t have read of him, but it did
seem that a fellow who had received offers from
fourteen schools and colleges should have been
heard of even in this corner of the world! Dick
put the trainer down as a person of a low order
of mentality.</p>

<p>He went into the stand and sat down there and
watched the practice. Evidently most of the fellows
at work were last year players, for they
handled the ball in a knowing way that precluded
their being beginners. No one who looked anything
like a coach was on hand, but a dark-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
fellow of eighteen, perhaps, who appeared in
command, was probably the captain. And a short,
stocky, important-looking youth who had discarded
his jacket and was wandering around in a very
blue silk shirt was just as probably the manager.
Dick didn’t seek him, for there would be plenty
of time to do that tomorrow. At intervals the
trainer summoned one of the candidates and sent
him off, usually prescribing a round of the running
track first. Dick was glad he did not have to
swallow that medicine today, for the weather was
extremely warm and humid. He thought that the
candidates averaged both heavier and older than
he had expected, and he wondered if by any chance
his lack of weight would be against him. One
of the quarter-backs out there, chasing a squad
about in signal drill, was, however, no bigger than
he, and possibly no older. Dick guessed he needn’t
trouble about lack of weight. Quarters didn’t
have to be big in order to make good. Presently
the practice ended and he followed the squad
toward the gymnasium and then went back to
Sohmer and climbed the slate stairway to the
second floor.</p>

<p>He remembered having closed the door of
Number 14 on going out, and since it now stood
wide open it was fair to assume that the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“S. G.” had returned, and Dick entered the study
eager, in spite of his seeming indifference, to find
out what Fate, in the shape of the school office,
had assigned to him as a room-mate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>ROOM-MATES</small></h2>


<p>The appearance of the study seemed to have been
changed in his absence, and Dick’s second glance
showed that the change was in the shape of several
pictures on the wall, some books on one of the
study tables and a large packing case in the centre
of the floor from which emerged the corner of a
brilliant blue cushion and the lower half of a boy.
While Dick looked the rest of the youth emerged
slowly until at last, somewhat flushed of face, he
stood entirely revealed, clutching triumphantly a
pair of battered running shoes. At that moment
his eyes fell on Dick and a surprised and very
pleasant smile came to his face. He tossed the
shoes to the floor, dusted his hands by a simple
expedient of rubbing them on his trousers, and
nodded, stepping around a corner of the big box.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “I suppose you’re Bates.
My name’s Gard.”</p>

<p>He held out a hand and Dick took it as he answered:
“Yes. Glad to meet you. We’re in here
together, I take it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Gard nodded. “Yes. I got here this noon and
helped myself to a desk, but I’m not particular
which I have. Same about the beds. We can
toss up, if you like.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter to me,” Dick replied.
“Suppose you take the first choice of a desk and
I’ll take the bed I want. That suit?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Gard was looking at Dick with frank
interest, leaning against the packing case, his arms,
on which he had rolled up the sleeves of a good-looking
shirt, folded. “Yes, that’s fair enough. I
took that desk because it happened to be nearest
the box, and I’ll keep it.”</p>

<p>Dick laid his hat down and seated himself on the
window-seat.</p>

<p>“It’s smaller than I thought it would be,” he
said, looking about the study.</p>

<p>“Oh, big enough, isn’t it? It is one of the
small ones, though. Some of the rooms on the
front are corkers, Bates. I couldn’t afford one
of those, though, and this is a lot better than the
room I had last year in Goss.”</p>

<p>“Then you—you’re not a new fellow?”</p>

<p>Gard shook his head. “This is my second year.
I’m in the Third Class. Are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think I could have passed for the
Fourth, but I guess I’d had to work mighty hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to keep up, and I want to play football, you see.
So——”</p>

<p>“Of course! There’s no sense rushing through
things too much, Bates. If you’d gone into the
Fourth you’d have been through just when you
were beginning to like the school. You will like
it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I expect to. I had a brother here five or six
years ago, and he’s always cracked it up high.”</p>

<p>“That so?” Gard pulled the blue cushion from
the box and tossed it across the room. “Put that
behind you. Guess I’ll leave the rest of this truck
until after supper.” He seated himself in one of
the easy chairs and stretched a pair of rather long
legs across the carpet. “Let’s get acquainted,” he
added, smiling.</p>

<p>Dick liked that smile and answered it. But for
a moment neither followed the suggestion. Gard
was looking critically at the pictures he had hung,
and Dick had a good chance to size him up. His
room-mate was a bit taller than Dick, with rather
a loose-jointed way of moving. He didn’t look
exactly thin, but there certainly wasn’t any excess
flesh about him. The running shoes suggested
that he was a track athlete, and Dick surmised that
he was a good one. You couldn’t call Gard handsome;
perhaps he wasn’t even good-looking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
general acceptance of the word; but Dick liked
his face none the less. The forehead was high
and the lightish hair of a rather indeterminate
shade of brown was brushed straight back from
it. That happened to be a style of wearing the
hair that Dick had always objected to, but he had
to own that the fashion suited Gard very well. It
emphasised the lean length of the face and added
to the sharp, hawk-like appearance produced by a
curved beak of a nose, thin and pointed, and the
narrow jaws. But if Gard reminded Dick of a
hawk, it was a gentle and kindly one, for the mouth
was good-natured and the eyes, darkly grey, were
soft and honest. Gard wore good clothes with no
suggestion of extravagance. In age he was fully
seventeen, perhaps a year more. He moved his
gaze from the wall and it met Dick’s. Involuntarily
both boys smiled. Then each began to speak
at once, stopped simultaneously and laughed.</p>

<p>“You say it,” said Gard.</p>

<p>“I was going to ask if you were a runner.”</p>

<p>“I’m a hurdler. I’ve tried the sprints, but I’m
only as good as a dozen others. Sometimes I
‘double’ in the broad-jump if we need the points.
You look as if you might be fast on the track,
Bates. By the way, what’s the rest of your
name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Richard C. The C’s for Corliss.”</p>

<p>“That means Dick, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>“All right. Mine’s Stanley; usually abbreviated
to Stan. Have you ever done any running,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve done some sprinting. What’s the
hundred-yards record here?”</p>

<p>“A fifth. It hasn’t been bettered in years.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fifth better than I can do.”</p>

<p>“Same here. I tried often enough, too, but I
only did it once, and that was in practice, with a
hard wind at my back. You play football, you
said?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do you?”</p>

<p>Stanley shook his head. “Too strenuous for me.
I like baseball pretty well, but it interferes with
track work. Guess we’re going to have a corking
good eleven this year, and I hope you’ll make
it, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I may. The fellows look a bit
older and bigger than I expected they would,
though.”</p>

<p>“Well, they say you have a good deal of fun
on the Second Team, if you don’t make the first.
And next year you’ll probably be a lot heavier. I
don’t know many of the football crowd, or I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
take you around and introduce you. I wonder if
Blash would do you any good.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Wallace Blashington’s his full name. He plays
tackle on the team; right, I think. He might be a
good fellow for you to know if——” Stanley’s
voice trailed into silence.</p>

<p>“If what?” prompted Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, Blash is a queer customer. He’s really
a corking chap, but doesn’t take to many fellows.
That’s no insult to you, Dick. He—he’s just funny
that way. And he’s the sort that won’t do a thing
if he thinks you’re trying to pull his leg. Blash
hated me—well, no, he didn’t hate me; he didn’t
take the trouble to do that; but he certainly had
no use for me the first of last year. We get along
all right now, though.”</p>

<p>“What happened? To make him change his
mind, I mean.”</p>

<p>“That was sort of funny.” Stanley smiled
reminiscently. “We had some scrub skating
races last winter on the river and Blash and I
were entered in the two-mile event. There were
about twenty starters altogether, but we had them
shaken at the beginning of the last lap and Blash
and I hung on to each other all the way up the
river to the finish. I just managed to nose him out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
at the line, and he was a bit peeved, I guess. He
didn’t let on, but he was. So, a little while later,
when we were watching the other events, he came
over where I was and said: ‘I believe I could beat
you another time, Gard.’ ‘Well, perhaps you
could,’ I answered. ‘Maybe you’ll have a chance
to find out.’ I wasn’t cross, but I thought it was
a bit unnecessary, if you see what I mean.
‘Wouldn’t care to try it now, I suppose?’ he
said. I told him I was tired out, but I’d race him
if he liked as soon as the programme was finished.
‘Oh, never mind the rest of it,’ he said. ‘We’re
both through. Say we skate down the river a ways
and settle the question by ourselves.’ So we did.
We went about a mile down, beyond the flag, and
Blash said we’d skate a mile down and a mile back,
and that we’d turn at the old coal wharf. So we
went off together, Blash trying to make me set
the pace. But I wouldn’t and so we lagged along
abreast for half a mile or so. Then Blash laughed
and spurted and I went after him and we had it
nip and tuck all the way to the wharf. Coming
back there was a wind blowing down on us and we
had harder work. Blash was a half-dozen yards
ahead and when we came to a turn in the river he
stayed along the bank, thinking he’d be more out of
the wind. That seemed good sense and I hugged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
close behind him. Then, first thing I knew, the ice
went crack, and down went Blash. I managed to
swerve out and get by, but of course I had to go
back and see if he was all right.</p>

<p>“He was about ten feet from shore, flapping
around in a little squarish hole he’d made for
himself. I asked him if he could break the ice
and get ashore and he said he couldn’t, that it was
too thick to break with his hands. So I laid down
on the ice and crawled over to him, and he got hold
of my hands and I had him pretty nearly out when
the crazy ice broke again and we were both in
there! In fact, I went down so far that I came up
under the ice and Blash had to pull me out to
the hole. By that time we were both laughing so
we could hardly keep our heads out. The water
was just over our depth and the ice was too hard
to break with our hands, and we didn’t have anything
else until I thought of using a skate. That
meant getting boot and all off, and Blash sort of
held me up while I tried to untie the laces and
everything. We were getting pretty stiff with the
cold by then, Blash especially, but I finally
managed to get one boot off and began hacking at
the ice with the skate blade. It was slow work
until I had chopped off about a yard. Then we
got our toes on the bottom and after that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
easy and we crawled out. I wanted to beat it back
to school as fast as I could, but Blash said that
we’d catch cold and have pneumonia and die. He
said the best thing to do was light a fire. Of
course, I thought he was joking, but he pulled out
one of those patent water-proof match-safes and if
you’ll believe it the matches were perfectly dry!</p>

<p>“But the awful thing was that there were only
two matches there! However, we got a lot of wood
together and some dry marsh grass and twigs, and
all this and that, and I kept the wind off, and we
made the second match do the trick. In about two
minutes we had a dandy hot fire going, took off
our outer things and hung them around and we sat
there with our backs to the mud bank and steamed.
I don’t believe any fire ever felt as good as that
one did, Dick! Well, that’s all of it. Just before
dark, we started back and we never told anyone
about falling into the river for months afterwards.
We never found out which is the best two-mile
skater, but we did a lot of chinning and got to
know each other, and since then Blash and I have
been quite pally.”</p>

<p>“Quite an adventure,” said Dick. “It’s a
wonder you didn’t catch cold, though.”</p>

<p>Stanley laughed. “We did! For a week we
were both sneezing and snuffling horribly. Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
you what, Dick. If you haven’t got anything
better to do, we might go over and see Blash after
supper. I guess this truck can wait until tomorrow.
Only don’t say anything about football
to him. If you do he will think I brought you
over on purpose, so as to—well, you see what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. He might think I was swiping,”
Dick laughed. “But, look here, Stan, what could
he do, anyway? A fellow has got to make his
own way, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so. But it does help—somehow—to
know the crowd if you’re going in for
football. At least, it does with making the track
team. I don’t mean that there’s favouritism, but—oh,
I suppose if you happen to know a fellow
and know that he’s all right, you just naturally
take a bit more interest in him. That’s the way
I figure it out, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose this fellow Blash—er——”</p>

<p>“Blashington. Quite a mouthful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Suppose he asks me if I play football? Then
what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just say you do and change the subject.
By Jupiter, Dick, it’s ten after six! Let’s beat it
over and get some supper. Say, if you see the
steward tonight maybe you can get at my table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
if you’d like to. Tell him you’ve got friends there.
It’s Number 9. You can sit there tonight, anyway,
for Eaton’s not back yet, and you can have his
place. Know where the lavatory is? Got any
towels? Here, take one of mine. Your trunk
won’t get up until morning, probably. They have
so many of them that they can’t begin to handle
them all today. If you need anything let me know
and I’ll dig it out of the box for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got everything I want in my bag, I think.
Much obliged just the same, Stan.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the new friends closed the
door of Number 14 and made their way along The
Front, as the brick walk leading from side to side
of the campus was called. Stanley named the
buildings for Dick as they went along: the gymnasium,
then Goss Hall, Parkinson, Williams and
Alumni. Their journey ended there, but there was
still another dormitory nearby, Leonard, and,
beyond that, the residence of the Principal. Dick
nodded, but it was food he was thinking of just
then.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Stanley, “you can go to ‘Jud’s’
reception if you’d rather, but you’ll have a
poor time. You just shake hands with Jud and
a bunch of the faculty and Mrs. Jud and stand
around until you get tired and go home again.”</p>

<p>“Jud being Doctor Lane?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Right! The idea is that you’re to become acquainted
with the other fellows and the instructors,
but the old boys fight shy of it and the new boys
just stand and look at each other, and the faculty
always forgets your name the next morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t sound exciting,” acknowledged
Dick, “and I’m for cutting it out unless it’s
required.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, it’s elective,” laughed Stanley.
“We’ll blow over to Blash’s room presently. He
may not be there, but we can try.”</p>

<p>They had finished supper and were strolling
along the walk toward the west gate. Windows
were open in the dormitories and from the nearer
ones came the sound of voices and laughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Occasionally someone hailed Stanley and they
stopped for a moment while the latter held conversation.
There were groups of fellows on the turf
along The Front, for the evening was warm and
still. A bluish haze softened the twilight distances
and somewhere toward the centre of the town a
church bell was ringing. It was all very peaceful
and homey, and Dick felt no regrets for Leonardville.
At the gate which led onto the junction of
Linden and Apple Streets they paused a moment.
A belated arrival climbed tiredly out of a decrepit
taxi in front of Williams and staggered up
the steps bearing suit-case and golf-bag. Along
the streets and less frequently across the campus
the lights gathered brightness in the deepening
twilight, although westward the sky was still
faintly aglow.</p>

<p>“Where does Blashington room?” asked Dick
as they turned their steps back the way they had
come.</p>

<p>“Goss,” answered Stanley. “He rooms with
Sid Crocker, this year’s baseball captain.”</p>

<p>“Goss?” Recollection came to Dick. “I
wonder if you know a fellow named Quiggle—no,
that’s not his name. I don’t know what his name
is, but he rooms in Goss. He’s a tall, lanky chap
with a long nose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’d you meet him?” asked Stanley, interestedly.</p>

<p>Dick recounted the incident and, since he didn’t
happen to look at Stanley’s countenance while
doing so, was not aware of the smile that trembled
about the hearer’s lips. “He’s going to pay me
the rest of that money when I find him,” ended
Dick resolutely. “I thought maybe you’d know
who he is.”</p>

<p>“Well, the description isn’t very—er—whatyoucallit,
Dick,” replied the other gravely. “I
dare say the fellow was just having a joke with
you.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but he was too fresh. I felt like
an awful fool when the taxi driver called me down
for offering him half a dollar instead of seventy-five
cents. Well, I suppose I’ll run across him
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will,” Stanley assured him almost
eagerly “You’re absolutely certain to, Dick!”</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>“Joke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what are you snickering about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that? I—I thought I wanted to sneeze.
It’s sort of dusty this evening.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t noticed it,” said Dick suspiciously.
But Stanley’s countenance was quite devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
amusement, and he accepted the explanation. In
front of Goss, Stanley backed off onto the grass
and looked up to one of the third floor windows.</p>

<p>“There’s a light in his room,” he announced.
“Somebody’s in, anyhow. Let’s go up.”</p>

<p>So, Stanley leading the way, they climbed the
two flights of worn stairs, for Goss didn’t boast
slate and iron stairways, and traversed a length
of corridor to where the portal of Number 27 stood
partly open. Stanley thumped a couple of times
on the door and entered. Someone within said,
“Come in, Stan,” and Dick, following his friend,
saw a rather short, stockily-made youth stretched
on the window-seat at the end of the room. “Excuse
me if I don’t rise,” continued the boy. “I
happened to look out a minute ago and saw you
rubbering up here.” He shook hands with Stanley
and then, seeing Dick for the first time, muttered
something, and swung his feet to the floor.</p>

<p>“Shake hands with Bates, Sid,” said Stanley.
“Dick, this is Mr. Crocker, well-known in athletic
circles as a shot-putter of much promise.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” grumbled Crocker. “Glad to meet
you,” he added to Dick. “Sit down, you chaps,
if you can find anything to sit on. Blash has got
his things all over the shop. Bring up that chair
for your friend, Stan. You can sit here, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
put my feet on you. Pardon me if I return to a
recumbent position, will you? I’m very weary.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Blash?” asked Stanley. “Gone over
to Jud’s, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. He’s down the hall somewhere.
He suggested tossing up to see whether he or I
should unpack the bags, and he lost. So, of course,
he remembered that he had to see a fellow and
beat it. He will be back in a few minutes, I guess.
This is a fair sample of the way in which he meets
his obligations, gentlemen. I’m ashamed of
him.”</p>

<p>Sid Crocker sighed, stretched, and deposited his
feet in Stanley’s lap. He was a nice looking boy
of apparently eighteen years, with light hair and
a round, much tanned face. He seemed unnecessarily
serious of countenance, Dick thought, but
afterwards he found that Sid’s expression of
gravity was no indication of mood. Sid caught
Dick’s gaze and was reminded of his duties as
host.</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t quite get your name,” he said,
politely.</p>

<p>“Bates,” said Stanley. “We’re together over
in Sohmer. This is his first year.”</p>

<p>“Bates?” echoed Sid. “Bates! Where have
I—Ah! I remember.” He sank back against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cushions again, closing his eyes as though in deep
thought. Dick determined to be modest, but it was
flattering to find that someone here had heard
of him. He waited for Crocker to proceed, and so
did Stanley, but instead Sid wriggled off the window-seat.
“Just excuse me a minute, will you?”
He crossed to a chiffonier, opened a drawer and
fumbled within. “Just remembered something.
Fellow downstairs wanted me to lend him—er——”
Whatever it was the fellow downstairs
required they didn’t learn, for Sid removed something
from drawer to pocket and made for the
corridor. “While I’m about it,” he added from the
doorway, “I’ll find Blash and fetch him back.”
Dick got the impression that he was seeking to convey
to Stanley more than his words expressed, for
he stared very hard at that youth as he spoke and
continued to stare for an instant longer before he
disappeared.</p>

<p>“Rather a jolly old room,” said Stanley, when
they were alone. “These old places fix up
nicely, I think.”</p>

<p>Dick agreed. Personally he didn’t care for the
idea of sleeping and living in the same room, but
the low studding, and the deep window embrasure
and the scarred, dark-painted woodwork were
somehow very homelike. The walls held dozens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
pictures of all sorts: photographs, posters, engravings,
etchings, a veritable hodge-podge. Amongst
them were strange trophies, too: part of a wooden
board bearing the strange legend “TE WAY
S PASSING” in two lines, evidently half of a
sign that had been sawed in two; a fencing mask;
a canoe paddle with a weird landscape painted on
the broad end; a cluster of spoons and forks tied
together with a brown-and-white ribbon; several
tennis rackets; a lacrosse stick; a battered baseball
adorned with letters and figures and tacked
to the moulding by its torn covering; several faded
or tattered pennants, one bearing a big blue K which
Dick presumed stood for the rival school of Kenwood.
Between the two narrow beds was a good-sized
study table littered with books and clothing
and odds and ends awaiting Blashington’s return.
Two chiffoniers and three chairs about completed
the furnishings. The beds held bags, partly unpacked,
and two steamer trunks blocked the passages
between beds and table.</p>

<p>“Blash has had this room four years,” mused
Stanley. “Says he would be homesick if he went
anywhere else. The joke about Sid’s shot putting,
by the way, is that he tried it last fall and Blash
got a cannonball that weighed about thirty pounds,
and worked it off on him. Sid almost killed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
trying to putt it more than twelve feet. Then
he noticed that Blash and the others were using
another shot, and got onto the joke. Here they
come.”</p>

<p>With Sydney Crocker was a tall, thin fellow
who, to Dick’s utter amazement, wore a long and
drooping black moustache. Perhaps the gorgeous
luxuriance of that moustache was a surprise to
Stanley as well, for Dick noted that the latter
stared at it fascinatedly for a long moment ere
he greeted its wearer. Even then he seemed to
find difficulty in speaking. Perhaps the dust was
annoying him again. Dick awaited an introduction
while the thought that there was something
wrong with that moustache, grew from a mere suspicion
into a certainty. In the first place, no fellow
of Blashington’s age could grow such a thing.
In the second place he wouldn’t be allowed to
wear it in a preparatory school. In the third place
it was much too good to be true; too long, too
black, too—Why, of course, it was a false one
stuck on! Dick smiled knowingly as Blashington
stepped over a trunk and held out a bony
hand.</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you, Mr. Bates,” said Blashington,
heartily. “Any friend of Stan’s is mine
to the extent of ten dollars. Sit down, everyone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Dear me, you haven’t got these things put away
yet, Sid. So sorry to have you chaps find the room
in such a mess. I don’t know what Sid’s been doing,
I’m sure.” Blashington chatted on, but Dick
noted that there was a distinct air of restraint
about the others. Indeed, Stanley appeared to be
actually suffering from restraint, for his face
was very flushed, and the low sounds that came
from him spoke of deep pain.</p>

<p>“You are a new-comer, I understand, Bates,”
Blashington continued, smiling amiably behind
that ridiculous moustache. “I hope you will like
us and spend a pleasant and profitable year in
these classic shades.”</p>

<p>He said more, but Dick wasn’t listening now.
“Classic shades!” Where had he heard that
expression recently, and who had used it? Then
memory came to his aid and he knew! His face
stiffened and his cheeks paled. Blashington, reading
the symptoms aright, paused in his rhetorical
meanderings and laughed.</p>

<p>“Bates is on, Stan,” he said. “I see the warm
light of recollection creeping over his face.
Further attempts at disguise are futile, not to
say idle. The clock strikes twelve. Unmask!”
Blashington pulled the moustache from his face
and tossed it to the table. “Excuse the little jest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Bates. It was Sid’s thought. Like most of his
ideas, it didn’t work.”</p>

<p>Stanley and Sid were laughing enjoyably, but
Dick couldn’t find any humour in the trick. He
remained silent, while Sid gasped: “Gee, Blash,
you did look an awful ass with that thing on!”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, I seem to have offended Bates.
He doesn’t look as though he thought I was a bit
funny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Dick, stiffly. “Either now or
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Dick!” protested Stan. “Take a
joke, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Stan,” said Blashington. “Bates
has a right to feel peeved if he likes to. Look here,
Bates, I’m sorry I offended you. When you know
me better you’ll understand that I didn’t mean to.
Will that do for an apology?”</p>

<p>“I think the whole thing is awfully silly,” replied
Dick coldly, “but it’s of no consequence:
not enough to talk about.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of uncomfortable silence.
Then Stanley said hurriedly: “That’s all right
then! You mustn’t mind Blash, Dick: nobody
does.”</p>

<p>Blash, whose expression of deep contrition Dick
had thought suspiciously emphatic, chuckled. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
thank you, Stan, for them few kind words. Well,
now that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordial</i> has been restored,
how are you and everything? Have a good summer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, bully. Did you?”</p>

<p>“I had a busy one, anyway. I’ll tell you about
it some time. I suppose you’ve heard that Pat
isn’t coming back this year?”</p>

<p>“No! Why? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Gaines told me that he had a letter from Pat
about two weeks ago, saying that his father had
lost a lot of money and that he was going to work;
Pat, I mean, not his father: although it is likely
that Mr. Patterson will work, too. It sounds
reasonable, eh? I’m awfully sorry. Pat was a
dandy chap. Besides, he’s going to leave a big
hole to be filled.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Sid Crocker. “Patterson
was a corking quarter-back. And he would
have played on the nine next spring, I’ll bet. He
swung a mean bat on the Second last year, and
would have made a mighty good fielder for us, I
guess. Who will get his place, Blash?”</p>

<p>“Stone. Gus isn’t bad, but Pat came pretty
close to being a marvel. We’re talking about our
last year’s quarter-back, Bates. Do you care for
football?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick felt Stanley’s anxious look on him as he
answered: “Yes, I like football, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Do you play?”</p>

<p>“I have played—some.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We need talent this year, and
you look as if you might be clever.” Dick knew,
however, that Blash was only being polite.</p>

<p>“Do you play baseball?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“N—No, not much. Of course I have played it,
but I’m not good enough.” His manner was still
stiff, and he made no effort to remain in the conversation.
The others chatted on for some time
longer, Stanley frequently seeking to get Dick to
talk, but not succeeding, and then the visitors took
their departure.</p>

<p>“Drop in again, Bates,” said Blash. “If
there’s anything I can do to help, let me know.”</p>

<p>Dick thanked him non-committingly. Outside
Stanley shook his head. He was smiling, but
Dick knew that he wasn’t pleased. “I guess that
didn’t get us much, Dick,” he said.</p>

<p>Dick frowned. “Well, I can’t help it!” he said
defensively. “He makes me tired. Anyway, if
I can’t get along in football without his help, I’m
quite willing to stay out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that won’t make much difference, I suppose.
I only thought that if Blash took to you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t: any more than I took to
him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to have told you he was
the fellow you rode up from the station with, but
I didn’t realise that you were really so peeved
with him. It’s sort of too bad you couldn’t have
taken it as a joke, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” answered the other haughtily.
“I won’t trouble you to introduce me to any more
of your friends, Gard.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be waxy,” said Stan, good-naturedly.
“There’s no harm done. You may like
Blash better when you get to know him, and——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. And it doesn’t matter, does
it?”</p>

<p>“N—No, except that it’s always nicer to like
fellows than not to. You get more out of—out
of life, Dick. Well, never mind Blash. Want to
go over to Jud’s for a few minutes? It isn’t too
late.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Yes, I guess I will, but you
needn’t bother unless you want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come along. We don’t have to stay.
Hope there’ll be some eats, though.”</p>

<p>When they had turned back and were retracing
their steps along The Front, Dick broke a silence
of several minutes’ duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyway,” he said a trifle resentfully, “I
noticed one thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Stanley.</p>

<p>“Blashington took mighty good care not to say
anything about that twelve cents he owes me!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>“RUSTY”</small></h2>


<p>Two busy days followed for Dick. Stanley was
a great help, however, and getting settled into his
stride was accomplished fairly easily. There was
his adviser to see and his courses to arrange: he
was required to take seven courses, one of them
elective. For the latter he chose General History,
not so much because he felt a hankering for such
knowledge as the course afforded as because it
entailed but two recitations a week. You see, he
had to arrange so as not to have studies interfere
too much with football! However, there
seemed no danger of his not having enough school
work, for, with History, his grand total was
twenty-nine hours.</p>

<p>He passed his physical examination with flying
colours and on Wednesday set to work with the
football candidates. Of these there was a startling
number, he thought. The field that afternoon
was so thickly sprinkled with fellows of all sizes,
shapes and degrees of experience that there was
scarcely room to move about. Dick found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
simply one of many, doomed to go through with the
usual routine of the beginner. At first he felt
somewhat impatient and even peeved, but presently
he decided to view the thing as a joke. They
would very soon see that he belonged in an advanced
squad, he thought, and meanwhile it
wouldn’t do him any harm to practice the kindergarten
stuff with the rookies.</p>

<p>The coach didn’t appear until Thursday, and
when he came, Dick didn’t altogether approve of
him. In the first place, Dick considered him too
old: he looked to be every day of thirty-four or
five. In the second place, Coach Driscoll lacked
the good-natured, free-and-easy manner that
Dick’s experience had associated with football instructors.
He wasn’t bad looking, and he had
very evidently kept himself in good physical trim,
but, being so old, he would, Dick decided, be
horribly behind the times and out-of-date. “Tod”
Driscoll was a Parkinson graduate and a Yale
man. At Yale, he had established an enviable
reputation as a football player. He had been
coaching at Parkinson for five years, Dick learned,
and with success, for in that time the Brown-and-White
had thrice triumphed over the Blue of Kenwood.
And he was popular in spite of the fact
that he was a very strict disciplinarian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick found Captain Bob Peters more to his
liking. Peters was a homely, tow-haired, snub-nosed
chap built like a Greek athlete, with a smiling
countenance and a clear, creamy-brown skin
against which his grey-blue eyes looked startlingly
bright. He was cheerful and light-hearted and
yet could be very intense and very earnest on
occasions. He played at right end on the team.
Dick didn’t have any dealings with Captain Peters
at this period, however, for a youth named Warden
appeared to have control of his fortunes. Warden
was a dark-complexioned, earnest fellow who
never said an unnecessary word to the squad of
beginners over whom he had been placed, and who
worked very hard and conscientiously every
minute. Dick thought he took himself and his
duty a bit too seriously, but couldn’t help liking
and respecting him.</p>

<p>Dick was rather surprised at the extremely
earnest and business-like way in which football
practice was conducted. There was so much system
and everyone was so serious! Even the
manager and his hard-working assistant appeared
to have no thought in life beyond that of turning
out a successful football team. Billy Goode, the
trainer, alone seemed to be unaffected by the contagion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of effort. Billy even found time for a
laugh and a joke.</p>

<p>Naturally, Dick was especially interested in the
quarter-back candidates. He got one of the fellows
to point out Gus Stone to him, and was relieved
to find that Stone didn’t look very wonderful. He
was rather short and perhaps a bit heavier than
the position demanded, although doubtless a week
of work would remove some of the weight. There
was also Cardin, a slighter and younger boy who
had played the position on the Second Team last
year. And there were a dozen others, Dick
amongst them, who had declared their preference
for the quarter-back job.</p>

<p>He saw Wallace Blashington now and then on
the field or in the gymnasium, and Blash always
spoke, but there was no further meeting until
the following Saturday. By that time Dick had
settled down into the routine of school life, and had
decided that he was going to like Parkinson immensely
and Stanley Gard even more. Dick had
grown rather used to having other fellows wait
on him, run his errands and make life easy for him
in general. He had never consciously asked such
service, but had received it as a tribute to popularity.
But he was not getting it now. If he had
expected Stanley to wait on him—and he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
know whether he had or not, but probably had!—he
was doomed to disappointment. Stanley was
the best-hearted chap in the world, but if one of
Dick’s shoes had got away from him and taken up
a temporary abode under Stanley’s bed, it was
Dick who fished it out. Only once had Dick asked
a service. Then, seated at his study desk, he had
lightly suggested that Stanley should hand him a
book that was lying on the radiator top near the
window. Stanley was seated in a chair somewhat
nearer the radiator than Dick, but there was no
sound of movement and after a second Dick looked
around inquiringly. Stanley was still seated and
there was a quizzical grin on his countenance.
After a somewhat blank stare, Dick arose and got
the book. As he sat down again he said sarcastically:
“Much obliged, Stan.”</p>

<p>Stanley chuckled. “Dick, you’ve been sort of
spoiled, haven’t you?” he said.</p>

<p>“Spoiled? What do you mean? Just because I
asked you——”</p>

<p>“You’re one of those fellows who expect others
to do things for ’em, and get away with it.
Wish I knew the secret. But it isn’t good for you,
Dick. You must learn to run your own errands,
and whitewash your own fences. Any time you
break a leg, I’ll fetch and carry for you, but while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you’re able to get about—nothing doing! In fact,
seeing that I’m an older resident of this place, I’m
not certain you shouldn’t be fagging for me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens,” muttered Dick. “You
make me tired.” Then, after a moment, he added:
“Maybe that was cheeky, Stan. I’m sorry. Guess
I’ve had it too easy.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, son. It’s just as well to
know where we stand, though. Any other little
thing I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can close your silly mouth,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>By Saturday Dick felt almost like an old boy.
His courses promised to be only mildly difficult,
and the instructors seemed a very decent lot,
notably “Old Addicks” who knew so much of
ancient languages that he looked like an elderly,
benignant Greek philosopher, and Mr. McCreedy,
who taught mathematics. Through Stanley he met
a great many of the fellows, and he picked up a few
acquaintances himself. Of these latter, one was
“Rusty” Crozier. He was a Fourth Class fellow
who preferred to live in the town, and occupied
two comfortable rooms in a house on Maple Street,
just below the school. He was a jolly, light-hearted
chap with a perpetual smile and hair of that peculiar
shade of red that we associate with rusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
iron: hence his nick-name. Dick met him in classroom.
“Rusty” borrowed Dick’s fountain pen
for a minute. After class they came together
in the corridor and walked a little way along The
Front. That began it. When Dick asked Stanley
if he knew Crozier, Stanley nodded.</p>

<p>“Everyone knows Rusty,” he said. “But if
you want to tread the straight and narrow, Dick,
keep away from him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Isn’t he—all right?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Rusty’s all right. That is, there’s
nothing vicious about him. In fact, he’s a very
decent, very clean fellow. But he’s gifted with a
talent for discovering trouble. And a talent for
squirming out of it! If he wasn’t he’d have left
Parkinson long ago. I’d say that Rusty’s trouble
was an over-developed sense of humor.”</p>

<p>“I rather liked him,” mused Dick.</p>

<p>“You would. So do I. Everyone likes Rusty.
But wise guys say him nay when he suggests one
of his innocent amusements. It was Rusty who
closed traffic on Main Street in the middle of a
busy Saturday one day last year, only faculty
doesn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Did what?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“He borrowed two carpenter’s horses and a
sign and placed ’em across the middle of Main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Street, near School, about one o’clock one day
last spring. He found the sign somewhere, I don’t
know where. It said ‘Street Closed by Order of
Selectmen.’ Then he went over and stood in
Wiley’s drug store and watched the fun. It was
almost an hour before they discovered that it was
a hoax. The paper was full of it, and the selectmen
made an awful rumpus, but everyone else
thought it was a pretty good joke.”</p>

<p>“And he wasn’t found out!”</p>

<p>“No. At least a score of people must have
seen him set the barrier up, but no two of them
agreed as to what he looked like. Some said he
was a labourer in blue overalls, and others said
he was a tall man with whiskers, and so on. That’s
just one of Rusty’s innocent ways of amusing himself.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t he ever get caught?” asked Dick
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, heaps of times, but he always manages
somehow to show that he was actuated by good intentions
or that circumstances worked against him.
Like the time he dropped the parlour match heads
all over the floor in Room G and every time anyone
put his foot down, one of the things went <em>pop</em>!
He showed Jud the hole in his pocket where the
things had fallen out. If it hadn’t been for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hole, he claimed, it wouldn’t have happened. He
got off with a month’s probation, I think.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “He must be a cut-up! Well,
I’ll keep away from him when he feels frolicsome.”</p>

<p>“Trouble is,” said Stanley, “you never can
tell when Rusty is going to spring something.”
He smiled and then chuckled. “Three or four of
us walked over to Princeville two years ago to the
circus. It was one of those little one-ring affairs,
you know, with a mangey camel, and a moth-eaten
lion and a troop of trained dogs. It was rather
fun. Rusty was one of us, and he was as quiet as
a mouse until near the end. Then he began flicking
peanuts at the ring master. We tried to stop
him, but he wouldn’t quit. Every time the ring
master turned his back, Rusty would land a peanut
on him, and the crowd got to laughing and gave it
away. So they hustled us all out, and we didn’t
see the performing dogs. Has he asked you over
to his room at Spooner’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick, suspiciously. “Is there any
trick in that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Stanley, smilingly. “He
has very jolly quarters. If you like we’ll go over
together some evening.”</p>

<p>“All right. Only I don’t like that catfish grin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of yours. I suppose he has a trick staircase that
folds up and lets you down in a heap or something?”</p>

<p>“No. Rusty’s fun is pretty harmless. We’ll
wander over there tonight if you like.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I’m going to keep my eyes open just
the same,” Dick laughed “You’re too anxious
to go along, Stan!”</p>

<p>That afternoon Dick found a letter in the rack
downstairs. It bore the Warne postmark, and was
addressed to him in a very dashing hand: “Richard
C. Bates, Esq., Sohmer Hall, Parkinson
School, Town.” Wondering, Dick opened the
envelope. Within was an oblong of pasteboard
punched with three holes of varying sizes. In one
of the holes was an ancient looking cent so badly
corroded that it was hard to read the lettering.
Dick’s thoughts naturally fell on Rusty Crozier,
although what the joke meant, he couldn’t make
out. But he smiled and dropped the coin in a
waistcoat pocket, and presently forgot about it.
Returning from football practice at five, however,
he found another missive awaiting him. The
envelope was different and the writing different,
but there was just such another coin-card within
and in the card was a second penny. This one
was bright enough, but it had been badly bent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Dick, puzzled, added the second coin to the first,
resolved to find out the meaning of the prank that
evening.</p>

<p>He and Stanley went across the campus and
down Maple Street about eight. Spooner’s was a
large, square house standing almost flush with the
sidewalk. Like many of the residences thereabouts,
its upper floors were tenanted by students
unable or disinclined to secure rooms on the campus.
Stanley pulled open a squeaky screen door
and entered. At the foot of the staircase, he
paused and lifted his voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rusty!” he shouted. “Rusty-y-y!”</p>

<p>Somewhere above a door opened and a voice
answered.</p>

<p>“A-a-ay! Come up!”</p>

<p>Stanley led the way again up two flights, and
then to a door at the front of the house. Oddly
enough, it was closed tightly, which fact, since it
had been opened a moment before, struck Dick
as peculiar. Stanley knocked and a voice called
“Come in!” Somehow Stanley managed to get
behind Dick, and it was Dick who turned the knob
and pressed the door inward. The next instant he
was precipitated into a glare of light. The knob
had jerked itself out of his hand, and something—he
supposed at the moment the something to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
been Stanley—had banged against his heels and
pushed him violently into the room. He stopped
to find himself asprawl over an armchair with a
placard bearing the word WELCOME a few
inches from his nose.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Good evening,” said Rusty amiably</a> from
across the room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02">
  <img src="images/image02.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_63"><i>“Good evening,” said Rusty amiably</i></a></div>
</div>

<p>“Hello,” gasped Dick. Then he looked back
at the door for Stanley. Stanley was not there.
But at the instant the door opened again and
Stanley appeared. He was grinning broadly, but
Dick was too much interested in the door to see
it. The door was not opening like any door Dick
had ever seen. In the first place it was turning
on pivots at top and bottom, half of it coming in,
and half of it going out, so that the aperture for
entrance was scarcely wider than Stanley. In the
second place, Stanley was holding hard to that
knob and being fairly dragged through, for above
the sill and below the lintel was a coiled spring
that, so soon as the knob was turned, swung the
door swiftly on its axis from left to right. Dick
stared in surprise.</p>

<p>“Just a little idea of my own, Bates,” said
Rusty, coming forward and removing the placard
from the back of the chair to a place on the wall.
“Have a chair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick looked from the proffered chair to Rusty
and then to Stanley and shook his head. “No,
thanks,” he muttered. “I’ll stand!”</p>

<p>However, Stanley assured him on oath that the
chair was quite safe and wouldn’t double up under
him and he consented to try it, although not without
anxiety. But he was up again a moment
later, demanding to be shown the working of the
amazing door.</p>

<p>“Quite simple,” laughed Rusty. “First I
unlock it, thus. Then I stand clear of it. Then the
unsuspecting visitor outside turns the knob.” He
turned it from the inside, stepping quickly out
of the way, and the door leaped open, swung once
around and stopped as the latch snapped again
into its socket. “That’s all there is to it. I place
the cushioned chair here to receive the caller and
place the ‘Welcome’ sign where he will be sure to
see it. Most all the fellows know about it now,
though, and I have to rely on newcomers like you,
Bates, for a bit of fun.” He locked the portal
again.</p>

<p>“Well, but—but suppose you want to go out?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I go out the other door.” Rusty indicated
the adjoining bedroom. “In fact,” he added with
a twinkle, “I seldom use this entrance myself. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
keep it locked until I am expecting a distinguished
visitor.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see how you knew I was with
Stan,” Dick objected.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask Stan about that,” laughed
Rusty.</p>

<p>“I told him,” explained Stanley, grinning.</p>

<p>“Oh! Then that’s why you were so anxious to
come with me.” Dick fixed his room-mate with an
accusing eye. “All right. I’ll get even with you,
old son, if it takes my last—if it takes my last two
pennies!” He looked quickly at Rusty, but there
was nothing to show that the latter had grasped the
allusion. “Maybe,” continued Dick, “you’d like
to see them.” He fished the two cents from his
pocket and held them forth. Stanley viewed them
interestedly and so did Rusty.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” asked the former. “Do
you mean that you’re down to those? Stony broke,
Dick?”</p>

<p>Rusty’s innocent, uncomprehending expression
remained and Dick began to think his suspicions
wrong. “No, those are just—just pocket-pieces,”
he answered flatly.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be very useful to you in a pinch,”
observed his host. “Well, find seats, fellows.
Hope you didn’t mind the reception, Bates. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
I guess you didn’t. You look like a fellow who
can take a joke.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mind,” said Dick. “Guess I was
too surprised to mind!” He looked about the
room. “This is pretty comfortable, Crozier.”</p>

<p>“Not bad. I’ve had these rooms ever since my
first year. Got two nice windows in front and one
on the side there, and two more in the bedroom.
Mrs. Spooner is a corking old soul, and doesn’t
mind a bit of noise now and then.”</p>

<p>Stanley chuckled, and when Dick looked across
inquiringly he explained. “Mrs. Spooner’s as
deaf as a haddock, Dick. If she wasn’t she
couldn’t live in the same house with Rusty!”</p>

<p>“Run away! I’m not noisy. Sometimes my
guests are, but I do all I can to restrain them.
Haynes gives me more trouble than Mrs. S. He
has the room under this on the floor below, Bates,
and insists on studying at the times I feel playful.
There are four other fellows in the house and
you couldn’t pry any of us loose. You chaps can
have your dormitory rooms. I don’t want them,
thanks.”</p>

<p>“Do you take your meals here?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. S. doesn’t give meals. She used to,
but that was before my time. I eat around.
Usually at ‘The Eggery.’ Sometimes at Thacher’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Stan says you’re out for the football team.
Going to make it all right?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure. I’m going to try to.
Do you—are you——”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not athletic, Bates. My favourite
sport is mumblepeg. Besides, my studies prevent.
Oh, shut up, Stan! Let me make a good impression
on Bates, can’t you? What time is it,
anyway? Look here, let’s go to the movies. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” answered Stanley. “I’ve got
to beat it back and do some work tonight. Besides,
the last time——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” laughed Rusty. “Wasn’t it silly?
Such a fuss about so little, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, very little!” Stanley turned to Dick.
“He and Blash stretched a rope across the aisle
and tied it to the arms of the seats ahead of them.
Being fairly dark, some confusion ensued!”</p>

<p>“During which, if I remember correctly, you
and Joe and Blash sneaked out. Just shows what
a guilty conscience will do, Bates. I remained,
secure in my innocence, and saw the show
through.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you rotter!” said Stan indignantly.
“You put the blame on us, and every time I
go there now the doorman looks at me unkindly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you were out of the way and I wasn’t.
Besides, I wanted to see the rest of the picture.”</p>

<p>“Rusty, if you got your deserts,” said Stanley,
feelingly, “you’d be shot at sunrise. Well,
I must beat it. Coming along, Dick?”</p>

<p>Dick went, in spite of Rusty’s pleas. They left
by way of the bedroom and Dick watched the hall
door very, very carefully. It proved to be a perfectly
normal door, however. Rusty told Dick to
call again and held conversation with them over
the banister until they had reached the street door,
while from a second floor room came howls of
“Shut up, Rusty! Shu-u-ut u-u-up!”</p>

<p>“It’s only Haynes,” called Rusty reassuringly.
“Don’t mind the poor fish. Come again, fellows!
Good night!”</p>

<p>In the letter rack in Sohmer was another envelope
addressed to Dick and within was a third
penny.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>DICK MAKES AN ENEMY</small></h2>


<p>That was on Friday. The next afternoon Parkinson
played her first game, with Mapleton School.
Mapleton had started the Parkinson schedule for
several years, invariably providing just the
amount of fight desired, and today was no exception
to the established rule. Four ten-minute
periods were played and Parkinson managed to
run up seventeen points. It was a slow and uninteresting
game from the spectators’ standpoint,
and the afternoon was scorchingly hot for the last
of September. “Babe” Upton, who weighed well
over a hundred and eighty and played centre,
affirmed afterwards that he could feel himself melting
away like a candle. Indeed, although none of
the team was allowed to remain in the contest for
more than two periods, there were many who
found it hard medicine. Dick, who as a member
of the squad was supposed to look on and learn,
watched the game from the Parkinson bench and
sweltered uncomplainingly for the better part of
an hour and a half. Naturally enough, his interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
concentrated itself on Stone and, later, Cardin, the
quarter-backs. He secretly thought that Cardin,
with sufficient instruction, could be developed into
a better quarter than Gus Stone, for Cardin was a
quick, gingery youngster who drove his team hard,
while Stone, although more experienced and
heavier, had a tendency to go to sleep on his feet,
and the plays always dragged just when they
should have been run off at top speed. A third
candidate, a thin ramrod of a youth, was tried out
for a few minutes just at the end of the game. A
neighbour told Dick that his name was Pryne, adding
facetiously that it ought to be Prune. Pryne
had scant opportunity to show whether he deserved
the latter appellation, however.</p>

<p>When Mapleton had gone away and the stands
had practically emptied, the members of the squad
who had taken no part in the game were called out
for an hour’s work. Coach Driscoll did not remain,
and the job fell to Harry Warden, who because
of a weak ankle had been out of his place
at left half on the team that afternoon. By some
chance the running of one of the three makeshift
teams fell to Dick, and, with a few of the candidates
who had failed to get placed on the squads
following, he started off. The simplest sort of
plays were being taught, straight line bucks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
runs, outside ends and a rudimentary set of signals
was used. At first the men moved hardly faster
than a walk. Then, having presumably learned
their duties, they were allowed to trot. It seemed
to Dick that he was burdened with the stupidest
aggregation on the field, and one of the backs, a
shock-haired, long-nosed youth named Halden, outdid
them all. No matter how many times Halden
was walked through a play, the instant speed was
called for he forgot all he had learned. Finally,
after he had “gummed up” a simple two-man
attack on left guard for the third time, Dick’s
exasperation found voice.</p>

<p>“You! Eight half! What good do you think
you are? You’re supposed to go in there and
clear out that hole, and instead of that you let the
runner ahead of you and then walk all over his
heels! Can’t you understand that play? Don’t
you get the signal, or what’s your trouble?”</p>

<p>“I thought full-back went ahead,” grumbled
Halden.</p>

<p>“You thought! Great guns, haven’t you been
through that play often enough? Come on, now!
Try to get it right this time.”</p>

<p>Halden did get it right, but the effort so unnerved
him that he stopped as soon as he was clear
of the line and the full-back ran into him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right as far you got,” commented Dick,
bitterly, “but there’s supposed to be an opposing
line in front of you, Halden. Keep on going!
Here, we’ll switch that play to the other side and
you watch how it’s done.” This time the right
half cleared the hole on his own side and the full-back,
ball hugged to his stomach, plunged after
him. “Get it?” asked Dick of Halden.</p>

<p>“Sure,” growled the left half.</p>

<p>“Well, try it then. All right! 7—15—18—7——”</p>

<p>Halden started off much too soon, beating the
signal by a yard, and a trickle of laughter arose
from the squad. “Fine!” called Dick. “That’s
great work, Halden! But it’s usual to wait until
the ball is snapped! Here, you drop out and let
someone else in here for a while.”</p>

<p>“You’re not running this,” objected Halden,
angrily.</p>

<p>“I’m running this squad, and I don’t intend to
waste everyone’s time trying to drive a simple idea
into that concrete dome of yours!” Dick turned
to the followers. “Any of you fellows play half?”
he asked.</p>

<p>A volunteer stepped forward and Halden, muttering
and angry, dropped back. It was at that
instant that Dick noted the presence of Warden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
If he had known the Varsity man was there, he
might have been slower in assuming authority,
but, having begun, he kept on with it. “All right.
Left half, please. Now then, fellows, let’s get going
again. Mind the signals!”</p>

<p>Of course when he called on right half to take
the ball on a run outside, tackle one or two made
the mistake of supposing it was the unsuccessful
play that was called for and acted accordingly, but
that was to be expected. “I told you to mind
signals,” scolded Dick. “Don’t try to guess
what’s coming. Listen to me!” When the goal
line was reached and they swung around for a trip
back up the field, Dick saw that Warden had taken
himself off again and was somewhat relieved. He
had more than half expected a calling-down for
sending Halden out. Toward the end of the
signal drill the squad worked fairly well, although
Dick persisted in the belief that he had fallen
heir to the most stupid bunch on the field. When
dismissal came they trooped over to the benches
to get sweaters, and as Dick pulled his on he heard
Halden’s voice at his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Next time you bawl me out like that I’ll hand
you a punch on the nose,” growled the half-back
candidate. “You wouldn’t have done it if that
big fellow hadn’t been there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick’s head emerged from his sweater and he
viewed Halden coldly. “Son,” he said in as low
a voice as the other’s, “if you try any tricks
with me I’ll hurt you badly. And any time I’m
playing quarter where you are and you don’t show
any more intelligence than you did today, you’re
going to get roasted. You make the most of that,
Halden!”</p>

<p>“You try it!” hissed the other like a villain in a
melodrama. “You think you’re somebody, don’t
you? Well, you’ll get yours if you try to make a
goat of me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle!” said Dick disgustedly, elbowing
away. “Keep your temper if you want to play
football.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll be playing football when you’re
kicked off,” answered the other.</p>

<p>Dick shrugged and went his way, Halden following
gloweringly to the gymnasium. In the locker
room, Harry Warden crossed over and seated himself
beside Dick on the bench in front of his locker.
“Say, Bates,” he began, “you’ve done that sort
of thing before, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“What sort of thing?” asked Dick, a twinkle
in his eye. “Fired a fellow off the squad without
authority?”</p>

<p>Warden’s sober countenance showed the faintest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ghost of a smile: or perhaps it was only the eyes
that smiled. “I meant run off signals. I thought
you showed a good deal of familiarity with the
job.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I’ve done it before, quite often. I’ve
played three years, two of them on my high school
team. We all had to take hold and coach at times,
Warden. Our real coach couldn’t give us a great
deal of time. He worked in a hardware store,
you see, and his boss didn’t care a great deal about
football.” Dick smiled. “We couldn’t pay him
anything and he couldn’t afford to lose his job.”</p>

<p>“What school was that?” asked Warden.</p>

<p>“Leonardville, Pennsylvania, High.” Dick
watched to see if the information aroused recollection.
It didn’t. Evidently Fame didn’t travel
into New England.</p>

<p>“You played quarter-back?” Dick nodded.
“Hm.” Warden rubbed a cheek reflectively.
“What’s your weight?”</p>

<p>“One-fifty-one today.”</p>

<p>“You look lighter. That’s your build, though.
I liked the way you handled that bunch of dubs
today, Bates. Ever done much punting?”</p>

<p>“Not very much. We had a full-back who was
pretty nifty at that. I’ve done some drop-kicking,
though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you do two out of three from the thirty
yards?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if the angle isn’t too wide.”</p>

<p>Warden got up. “I wouldn’t be surprised,
Bates, if Driscoll took you onto the first squad
some day soon. Keep on the way you’re going,
will you? Let’s see if we can’t prove him wrong.
You know, Driscoll insists that you can’t make a
prep-school player from a high-school fellow. He
says they always know too much. Think it’s that
way with you?”</p>

<p>Dick looked haughty for an instant. Then he
smiled. “Why, I don’t believe so, Warden.
That’s a funny idea of his, though.”</p>

<p>“He says he’s never had much success with
high-school fellows,” said Warden thoughtfully.
“I know what he means, too. Maybe you wouldn’t
notice it, Bates, but it’s a fact that most chaps
who show up here from high schools have mighty
good opinions of themselves. Half the time
they’ve been captains of their teams, you know,
or crack half-backs or quarters, and they don’t
take kindly to new ways and hate being told anything.
I know two or three cases myself. By the
way, you weren’t captain, were you?”</p>

<p>“No.” Dick didn’t explain that he might have
been had he remained in Leonardville! “I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
say, though, that it depended on the fellow, Warden,
and not on the fact that he’d been playing
with some high-school team.”</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe. Well, see you again, Bates.
And, by the way, you did just right to drop that
chap this afternoon. So long.”</p>

<p>When he had gone Dick sat and nursed one
bare foot for several minutes and wondered what
Warden’s interest portended. He felt rather
cheered-up when he finally went on with dressing
himself. Warden’s remark about Coach Corliss
and the first squad sounded good to him.</p>

<small>PAGING MR. BLASHINGTON</small></h2>


<p>There were two more pennies awaiting him on
the letter rack, each enclosed in a business envelope.
One envelope bore the inscription, “After
Five Days Return to The Warne Gas and Electric
Company, Warne, Mass.,” and the other purported
to have come from the “Stevens Machine Company.”
But the handwriting was suspiciously
the same on each envelope. Upstairs, Dick handed
the two to Stanley and told about receiving the
previous three pennies. For a moment Stanley
seemed as puzzled as Dick. Then, however, a
smile spread itself slowly over his face and he
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Anybody owe you any money?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not that I know——” began Dick. Then
comprehension dawned. “By Jove! You mean
Blashington?”</p>

<p>“Of course. It’s just the crazy sort of thing
he’d do. He owed you twelve and a half cents,
didn’t he? Well, he’s paying his debt. But
where he manages to get hold of all these bum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pennies is beyond me. There isn’t one of the five,
Dick, that you could pass on anyone but a blind
man!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s putting him to a lot of trouble, I’ll
bet,” said Dick grimly. “If he can stand it I can.
Funny, though, I didn’t think of him. I thought
yesterday it was Rusty Crozier. That’s why I
showed them to you last night. Crazy ape!”</p>

<p>“Hand me a scrap of paper and a pencil, Dick.
Anything will do. Thanks.” Stanley wrote a few
lines, folded the paper many times and handed it
back. “Just for fun, Dick, when Blash has made
his last payment, you read what I’ve written
there,” he directed.</p>

<p>“Gee, you’re as bad as he is for silly jokes,”
grumbled Dick. But he opened the drawer in his
desk and dropped the paper inside. “And that
reminds me that I ran across another crazy idiot
this afternoon. His name’s Halden. He wanted
to punch me because I called him down for balling
up a play in signal drill. Know him?”</p>

<p>“Sanford Halden?” Stanley nodded. “Know
who he is, yes. He’s a sort of a nut. Goes in for
everything and never lands. Used to think he
was a pole-vaulter. Then he tried the sprints and—well,
I guess he’s had a go at about everything.
The only thing I ever heard of his doing half-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
well is basket-ball. I believe he’s fairly good at
that. Usually gets fired, though, for scrapping.
They call him Sandy. He’s a Fourth Class
fellow.”</p>

<p>“Is he? I thought he was probably Third. He
must be older than he looks then.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s only seventeen,” said Stanley.
“He’s smart at studies. He’s one of the kind who
always knows what he’s going to be asked and
always has the answer. It’s a gift, Dick.” And
Stanley sighed.</p>

<p>“He’s going to have another gift,” laughed
Dick, “if he gets fresh with me! Talk about your
stupids! He was the limit today. Had hold up
the whole squad while he was being taught the
simplest play there is. Then he had the cheek to
threaten to punch my nose! I hope they let me
run a squad tomorrow and put him on it!”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Dickie. Halden’s a joke.
Don’t let him bother you. Let’s go to supper.
Don’t forget this is movie night.”</p>

<p>Going to the movies was a regular Saturday
night event at Parkinson and usually a good half
of the school was to be found at one or the other
of the two small theatres in the village. Tonight,
perhaps because of the heat, the stream that
trickled across the campus to the head of School<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Street as soon as supper was finished was smaller
than usual, and Dick and Stanley, Blash and his
room-mate, Sid Crocker, commented on the fact
as they started off.</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” hazarded Sid, “they don’t
have the right sort of pictures. Gee, they haven’t
shown Bill Hart since ’way last winter!”</p>

<p>“How do you know! They may have had a
Hart picture while we’ve been away. What I
kick about is this educational stuff. I suppose it
doesn’t cost them much, but I’m dead tired of
Niagara Falls from an airplane and gathering
rubber in Brazil—or wherever they do gather it—and
all that trash.” Blash shook his head disgustedly.
“Hope they’ll have a real, corking-good
serial this year. Nothing like a good serial to
keep a fellow young and zippy.”</p>

<p>“They give us too much society drool,” said
Stanley. “Pictures about Lord Blitherington losing
the old castle and his string of hunters and
going to America and stumbling on a gold mine
and going home again and swatting the villain
and rescuing the heroine just as she’s going to
marry the old guy with the mutton-chop whiskers.
I wish they’d let her marry him sometimes. Guess
it would serve her right!”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve got a pretty good bill at the Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
tonight,” said Dick. “That Western picture
looks great.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but who’s this guy that’s in it?” demanded
Sid suspiciously. “Who ever heard of
him before?”</p>

<p>“Everyone but you, you old grouch,” Blash
assured him sweetly. “Come on or we’ll have to
stand up until the first picture’s over.”</p>

<p>Adams Street was quite a busy scene on a Saturday
night, for the stores kept open and the residents
of a half-dozen neighbouring hamlets came
in to do the week’s buying. While they were making
their way through the leisurely throng Sid
had a fleeting vision of Rusty Crozier, or thought
he had. Stanley said it was quite likely, as Rusty
was a great movie “fan.” Then they were part
of the jam in the entrance of the Scenic Temple,
and Blash, because of superior height, had been
commissioned to fight his way to the ticket window.
Followed a scurry down a darkened aisle
and the eventual discovery of three seats together
and one in the row behind. Blash volunteered for
the single one and since it was directly behind the
seat occupied by Dick the latter subsequently
shared with Stanley the benefit of Blash’s observations
and criticisms. A news weekly was on the
screen when they arrived, and Blash had little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
say of the pictured events, but when Episode 17
of “The Face in the Moonlight” began he became
most voluble. Stanley kept telling him to shut up,
but Dick, who didn’t find the serial very enthralling,
rather enjoyed Blash’s absurdities. A comedy
followed and then came a Western melodrama
with a hero who took remarkable chances on horseback
and a heroine who had a perfect passion for
getting into trouble. There were numerous picturesque
cow-boys and Mexicans and a villain
who, so Blash declared delightedly, was the “dead
spit” of Mr. Hale, the instructor in physics. Just
when the picture was at its most absorbing stage
the piano ceased abruptly and after an instant of
startling silence a voice was heard.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Wallace Blashington in the house?
Mr. Wallace Blashington is wanted at the telephone!”</p>

<p>The piano began again and the usher, a dimly
seen figure down front, retreated up the aisle like
a shadow. The three boys in front turned to Blash
excitedly.</p>

<p>“What is it, Blash?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Better go see,” counselled Stanley.</p>

<p>“Are you sure he said me?” whispered Blash.
He sounded rather nervous.</p>

<p>“Of course he did! Beat it, you idiot! Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
back if you can. Ask the man next you to hold
your seat, Blash.”</p>

<p>“We-ell—but I don’t see——” muttered Blash.
Then he got up, dropped his cap, groped for it and
found it and pushed his way past a long line of
feet, stepping on most of them. At the back of
the theatre an usher conducted him to the
ticket booth and he picked up the telephone receiver.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “Hello! This is Blashington!”</p>

<p>“Hello! Is that you, Mr. Blashington?” asked
a faint voice from what seemed hundreds of miles
away.</p>

<p>“Yes. Who is talking?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Wallace Blashington?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Who——”</p>

<p>“Of Parkinson School?”</p>

<p>“Yes! What—who——”</p>

<p>“Hold the line, please. Baltimore is calling.”</p>

<p>Then followed silence. Blash wondered. He
tried to think of someone he knew in Baltimore,
but couldn’t. He felt decidedly nervous without
any good reason that he knew of. Through the
glass window he saw the doorman watching him
interestedly. Beside him the girl who sold tickets
pretended deep absorption in a magazine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
chewed her gum rhythmically, but Blash knew
that she was finding the suspense almost as trying
as he was. After what seemed to him many minutes
a voice came to him. It might have been a
new voice, but it sounded to Blash much like that
of the first speaker.</p>

<p>“That you, Wallace!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Who are you?”</p>

<p>“This is Uncle John.”</p>

<p>“<em>Who?</em>”</p>

<p>“Uncle John, in Baltimore.”</p>

<p>“Unc—Say, you’ve got the wrong party, I
guess! Who do you want?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this Wallace?”</p>

<p>“This is Wallace Blashington!” Blash was
getting peevish. “I haven’t any Uncle John in
Baltimore or anywhere else!” The ticket girl sniggered
and Blash felt his face getting red. “I say
I haven’t——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wallace? I can’t hear you very well.
I’ve just had word from Dick, Wallace, and——”</p>

<p>“Dick who? I say Dick <em>who</em>!” roared Blash.</p>

<p>“Yes, Wallace, I’m sure you do. Well, this is
what he says. I’ll read it to you. ‘Tell
Blash——’ He calls you Blash. ‘Tell Blash he
needn’t bother——’”</p>

<p>“Needn’t <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Needn’t bother! ‘Tell Blash he needn’t bother
to send the other——’ Are you there, Wallace?
Did you get that?”</p>

<p>“Yes! But who is talking? What is—Look
here, I don’t understand——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wallace, I’ll speak more distinctly.—‘Not
to bother to send the other seven and a
half cents!’”</p>

<p>“What cents? Say, look here! Who is Dick?
Dick who? What——”</p>

<p>“Dick Bates,” answered the ghostly voice.</p>

<p>Blash stared for an instant at the instrument.
Then he said: “You—you——” in an oddly
choked voice, banged the receiver back on the hook
and bolted through the door. He was aware that
the ticket girl was giggling and that the doorman
eyed him amusedly as he hurried into the theatre
again and he wondered if they were parties to the
hoax. In the darkness at the back of the house
he paused and fanned himself with his cap, and
as he did so he chuckled.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” he whispered to himself. “Not
a-tall bad!”</p>

<p>Then he made his way down the aisle, located
his seat after much difficulty and crawled back to
it over many legs and feet. Three concerned faces
turned sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“No bad news, I hope?” said Stanley in an
anxious whisper.</p>

<p>“Anything important?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>Dick looked but said nothing, and Blash, his
lips close to Dick’s ear, hissed threateningly:
“One word from you, Bates! <em>Just one word!</em>”</p>

<p>Instead of speaking, however, Dick turned his
face to the screen again, his shoulders shaking.
Further along, where Sid sat, there was a faint
choking sound. Then Stanley said: “<em>Oh, boy!</em>”
and fell up against Dick. Again that queer choking
sound, then a gurgle, followed by a muffled
explosion of laughter from Dick, and Stanley was
on his feet, pushing Sid ahead of him, and Dick
was following weakly on his heels, and a second
after all three were plunging wildly up the darkened
aisle.</p>

<p>“Ex-excuse me,” muttered Blash. He clutched
his cap and wormed his way past a dozen exasperated,
protesting members of the audience and
pursued his friends. He found them in the lobby
outside. Stanley was leaning against the side of
the entrance, Sid was draped over a large brass
rail, and Dick, midway, was regarding them
from streaming eyes, one hand stretched
vainly forth for support. The contagion of their
laughter had involved doorman and ticket girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
while a small group of loiterers beyond were grinning
sympathetically. On this scene appeared
Blash. Stanley saw him first and raised one arm
and pointed in warning. Dick looked, gave forth
a final gasp of laughter and fled on wobbling legs.
Sid and Stanley followed and Blash brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>Down Adams Street in the direction of the railroad
station went hares and hound, the hound
gaining at every stride. Dick took to the street
early in the race, the sidewalk being much too
congested for easy progress, and had hair-breadth
escapes from cars and vehicles. To him the station
came into sight like a haven of refuge, and
there he was run to earth in a dim corner of the
waiting-room. When Stanley and Sid reached the
scene, outdistanced by Blash, Dick was lying on a
bench and Blash was sitting on him in triumph.</p>

<p>“Apologise!” panted Blash. “Say you’re
sorry!”</p>

<p>“I—I——” gurgled Dick.</p>

<p>“Say it, you lobster!”</p>

<p>“’Pologise!” grunted the under dog. “Sorry
I—Oh, gee!” And, Blash arising from his prostrate
form, Dick went off again into a paroxysm
of laughter, while Stanley and Sid sank weakly
onto the bench and wiped their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who did you get to do it?” asked Blash a
few minutes later when they were making their
way back to school. “Who was on the ’phone?”</p>

<p>“Rusty Crozier,” chuckled Dick.</p>

<p>“Rusty! And I didn’t recognise his voice! I
guess, though, he put a pebble under his tongue
or something.” Blash laughed. “Say, fellows,
I’d have sworn he was a thousand miles away!”</p>

<p>“He—he stood away from the ’phone,” Dick explained.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Blash was silent a moment. Then: “I
suppose you two silly pups were in on it,” he
accused.</p>

<p>“I was,” acknowledged Stanley. “Dick and I
hatched it up at supper. Sid didn’t know until
you’d gone out to the telephone. Rusty went to
the theatre first and found out what time the big
picture was coming on. We passed him on Adams
Street and I was afraid you’d see him and suspect
something. But I guess you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see him. Where did he telephone
from, Stan?”</p>

<p>“The hotel, right across the street. He said he
could watch you from there while he talked!”</p>

<p>“Wait till I get hold of him!” said Blash. Then
he laughed again. “Well, it was pretty cute, fellows.
The joke was on me that time!”</p>

<small>HALDEN REPEATS</small></h2>


<p>Of course the joke was too good to keep, and two
days later Blash’s friends—and he had a good
many—developed a disconcerting fashion of greeting
him with: “Is Blashington in the house?”
Blash, however, could take a joke as well as play
one. Dick had secret doubts as to his right to
accept credit for the conspiracy, for without Stanley
it could never have been born. Still, like a
great many other great ideas, it had, in a manner
of speaking, fashioned itself, and perhaps Dick
had had as much to do with it as Stanley.</p>

<p>On the following Monday Dick found himself
again in charge of one of the squads in practice.
He had a suspicion that Harry Warden had said
a good word for him to the coach, for more than
once he found the latter watching him. With this
encouragement Dick buckled down and worked
very hard with the somewhat discouraging material
supplied him. Halden was not with him today,
but there was an excellent understudy for him
in the shape of a chunky youth named Davis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Davis was just as slow as Halden had been, but he
didn’t gloom or grouch. He was cheerful and
apologetic and really tried hard, and Dick took a
good deal of trouble with him and was extremely
patient. When the squads were called in and the
scrimmage began Davis insinuated himself between
Dick and a neighbour on the bench.</p>

<p>“Say, Bates, I’m mighty sorry I was so stupid.
And it was white of you to let me down easy the
way you did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. You tried, and that’s
more than some of them did. Look here, Davis,
why don’t you brush up on the signals a bit before
tomorrow? You didn’t seem to remember them
very well.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that I can’t think quick enough,
Bates. You say ‘Six! Twelve! Fourteen!’ and I
know that I’m going to have the ball——”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not!” laughed Dick. “Not on
those signals!”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, that’s right! Well, ‘<em>Five</em>, twelve,
fourteen, then. What I mean is, that while I’m
getting the first number you call the third and
then the ball is snapped and I haven’t found out
where I’m going with it!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Can’t think quick enough, eh?
You’ll have practice on that then. Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Davis, who told you you were made for a
back?”</p>

<p>“No one, but you see I sort of wanted to play
there. You don’t think I can?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to say that,” answered Dick
kindly, “but I do think you’d do better work in
the line. Seems to me you’d fit in pretty well at
guard.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m too short,” said Davis sadly.
Then, brightening: “But I wouldn’t have to remember
so many figures, would I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, you’d have another second or
so to think about them,” chuckled Dick. “Why
don’t you tell the coach you’d like to try playing
guard? You are a bit short, but you’ve got weight
and you look husky. How old are you? Sixteen?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen. I don’t look it, do I? Say, I suppose
you wouldn’t want to speak to Mr. Driscoll,
would you?”</p>

<p>“Me? It wouldn’t do any good, my speaking
to him, Davis. I’m just one of the dubs like the
rest of you.”</p>

<p>Davis appeared to doubt that. “I thought—Well,
you won’t be long. Anyone can see that you
know the game. Maybe I’d better ask Bob Peters,
though. I’m sort of scared of Mr. Driscoll.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Davis, go to it. Neither of them will
bite you, I guess. Were you here last year?”</p>

<p>Davis nodded. “And the year before. I’m in
the Third.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you? Well, how does Mr. Driscoll
stand with the fellows?”</p>

<p>“Stand with them? Oh, ace-high, Bates,” answered
the other earnestly. “He’s a corker!
Don’t you like him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him, but it seems to me he’s
sort of old for the job. And he doesn’t seem
to——” Dick stopped. “Oh, I don’t know, but
he acts a bit stand-offish, and football seems so
much of a <em>business</em> here! I guess I can’t explain
just what I mean.”</p>

<p>Evidently he hadn’t, for Davis looked blank.
“He isn’t though,” he affirmed. “Stand-offish I
mean. I like him immensely. Most everyone
does. And he can turn out good teams,
Bates.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the main thing. I wonder if we
have punting practice after the scrimmage. Who
is the skinny chap that was in charge of the punters
Friday?”</p>

<p>“Gaines. He’s playing on the further squad
there. See him? At right half: the fellow with
the new head-gear. He’s pretty good, too. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
played right half last year. I’m no use at punting.
Guess my leg’s too short.”</p>

<p>“That can’t be my trouble,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, you! I thought you were mighty good
at it,” said Davis approvingly. “I wish I could
do half as well as you did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can get distance sometimes,” acknowledged
Dick, “but I’m just as likely to kick
to one corner of the field as the other! Direction
is the hard thing.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, only it’s all hard for me.” After
a moment of silence he said: “Do you know, Bates,
half my trouble today was that I was scared. I
was afraid you’d jump me the way you did Sandy
Halden the other day.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t on the squad that day,” answered
Dick, puzzled.</p>

<p>“I was trailing behind. When you let Sandy go
I wanted to take his place, but I was pretty sure
I’d do even worse! You ought to have heard
Harry Warden chuckle when you slammed Sandy.”</p>

<p>“Did he? Well, I had a lot of cheek to do that,
because I wasn’t supposed to change the line-up.
But Halden was too much for me. Has he played
before this year?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! Sandy tried last year, but they
dropped him to the Second and he got peeved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
quit. He’s always trying something. He had the
golf bug last Fall and thought he was going to
do wonders. But that petered out, too. Nobody
would play with him after awhile because he was
always blaming things on them. If he topped a
ball he said the other fellow had coughed or moved
or something. He was playing with Rusty Crozier
one day: Rusty’s a mighty good player: and he
was fiddling over his ball on a tee when Rusty
began swinging his club behind Sandy. Sandy told
him he should keep still when his adversary was
playing. Rusty had heard a lot of that and he got
mad. ‘That so?’ he asked. ‘Let me show you
something, Sandy.’ He pushed Sandy aside, and
took a fine long swing at Sandy’s ball and sent it
into the woods over by the old quarry. ‘There,’
he said. ‘Now you go hunt for that, Sandy, and
when you find it try to swallow it. Maybe you’ll
choke on it!’”</p>

<p>“Did he find it?” asked Dick amusedly.</p>

<p>“Don’t think so. Anyway, he hasn’t choked
yet!”</p>

<p>On Wednesday Sandy Halden fell to Dick’s
squad in signal drill. There had been a very
strenuous twenty minutes with the tackling dummy
and most of the fellows were still smarting under
the gentle sarcasms of Billy Goode, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
nursed sore spots as well. Halden had failed as
signally as any of that particular squad to please
the trainer and had come in for his full share of
disparagement, and his temper was not of the
best when signal work began.</p>

<p>Dick resolved to have no trouble with Halden;
nor any nonsense either. But Halden started off
more hopefully today and managed to get through
the first ten minutes of drill without a mistake.
He showed Dick, however, that he was still resentful
by scowling on every occasion. Davis had, it
appeared, found enough courage to ask for his
transfer to the line, for he was on Dick’s squad
at left guard. Of course, with none to oppose him
Davis managed to go through the motions satisfactorily
enough, but whether he could ever be
made into a good guard remained to be seen.
There were five signal squads at work that afternoon,
and several of them were followed by
blanketed youths for whom no positions remained.
Coach Driscoll and, at times, Billy Goode and
Manager Whipple moved from one squad to another,
the coach, however, devoting most of his
time to the squad containing the more promising
of the substitute material—or what seemed such at
that early period. Captain Peters was at right
end on the first squad, which held all of last season’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
veterans: Furniss, Harris, Cupp, Upton,
Newhall, Wendell, Stone, Gaines, Warden and
Kirkendall. The weather had turned cold since
Saturday and there was a gusty north-east wind
quartering the field, and the more seasoned squads
were charging up and down the gridiron with
much vim.</p>

<p>Dick had his men pretty well warmed up at the
end of ten minutes and plays were going off fairly
smoothly. Then, down near the east goal, came
the first serious mix-up in the back field. Showers,
playing full-back, had received the ball from centre
direct and was to make the wide-turn run outside
his own left end, the two half-backs going ahead
as interference. It was a play that had already
been gone through half a dozen times that afternoon.
But now for some unknown reason Halden,
instead of sweeping around to the left in the wake
of the other half, plunged straight ahead at the
right guard-tackle hole and emerged triumphantly
beyond. His triumph ceased, though, when he saw
Showers and the right half-back trotting along a
good fifteen yards distant. He pushed through
toward Dick, who had been engaged with a mythical
opposing back, scowling darkly.</p>

<p>“You called for a straight buck!” he challenged.</p>

<p>“Wrong, Halden,” replied Dick quietly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
called for a run outside left end and you were
supposed to be in advance of the ball.”</p>

<p>“You got your signal wrong, then!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Everyone else understood it.
We’ll try it again presently, Halden. See if you
can get it right next time.”</p>

<p>“I got it right that time. I heard the signal,
and it was——”</p>

<p>“Hire a hall, Sandy,” advised a lineman. “You
were all wrong.”</p>

<p>“I was not! Bates doesn’t give the signals so
anyone can get them, anyway. He talks down in
his boots!”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Halden. Signals! 9—11—You’re
out of position, Halden. Come on, come
on!”</p>

<p>“What’s eating you? I’m in position!”</p>

<p>“You are now, but you weren’t. Signals! 9—11——”</p>

<p>“I haven’t moved an inch!”</p>

<p>“Well, do it now then. Move a couple of hundred
inches and get out of here.” Dick looked
around for someone to take Halden’s place, but
there were no followers today. Halden had turned
very red and now he stepped up to Dick sputtering.</p>

<p>“You can’t put me off, you smart Aleck! I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
put here by Driscoll and I’ll stay until he tells me
to go. You think you’re the whole thing, don’t
you? How do you get that way? You make me
sick!”</p>

<p>Dick made no answer, but he watched Halden
closely, for the boy was quite evidently in a fighting
mood. It was Davis who came to the rescue
by slipping out of his place in the line and inserting
himself suddenly between Halden and Dick.</p>

<p>“Sure, he’s got a right to fire you, Sandy, and
you’re fired! So beat it!” Davis pushed Sandy
playfully away. “Bates is boss, son.”</p>

<p>“He is not! He’s no more on this squad than
I am! Quit shoving me, Short!”</p>

<p>“Driscoll is looking over here,” warned Showers
uneasily. “Let’s get at it, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” responded Davis, jumping
into his place again. “Let her go, Bates!”</p>

<p>“I must have another half-back,” answered
Dick, looking about.</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” growled Halden. “I’m not going
off.”</p>

<p>“I think you are,” replied Dick quietly. He
left the squad and walked across to where Billy
Goode was standing with Manager Whipple.
“I’m short a half-back,” he announced. “Got
someone, Mr. Trainer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Someone hurt?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve let Halden go. He tried to make
trouble.”</p>

<p>Billy looked at Dick quizzically. “<em>You</em> let him
go! What do you know about that?” He turned
inquiringly to Stearns Whipple.</p>

<p>Whipple smiled. “Benson’s not working,” he
said. “Give him Benson.”</p>

<p>“Would you?” Billy shot a look of mingled disapproval
and respect at Dick. “Well, all right.
Send Halden to me. Say, what’s your name?
Gates? Oh, Bates! Well, if I was you Bates, I
wouldn’t get too uppity.” Billy went off for Benson
and Dick started back toward his waiting
squad, followed by the amused regard of Whipple.
Benson trotted out from behind a neighbouring
group and joined Dick.</p>

<p>“Billy sent me over,” he said. “I’m a half-back.”</p>

<p>“Go in at left, will you? That’s all, Halden.
Goode says to report to him.”</p>

<p>Halden walked up to Dick and spoke very softly.
“I’ll get you, Bates, if it takes a year!” he said.</p>

<p>Dick nodded. “Come on, fellows! Signals!”</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later Coach Driscoll found
Dick on the bench while the first and second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
squads were taking the field for the scrimmage.
“Whipple tells me you had trouble with Halden,”
he said. “What was wrong, Bates!”</p>

<p>“He tried to hold up work arguing whether he
or I was wrong about a signal I gave.”</p>

<p>“Who <em>was</em> wrong!”</p>

<p>“He was, sir, but that didn’t matter. He
wouldn’t work. Just wanted to chew the rag. So
I let him go.”</p>

<p>The coach smiled faintly. “You probably did
right, Bates, but perhaps in future you’d better
report the matter to me first. You see some fellows
might question your authority.” The
coach’s smile grew. “Well, I dare say Halden
won’t trouble you again.” He nodded and went
off. Dick looked after him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“When he smiles he doesn’t look so old,” he
said to himself.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>LETTERS AND RHYMES</small></h2>


<p>Dick’s home letters became shorter about this
time. Life was very busy for him. He wrote the
news, but he no longer indulged his pen in descriptions.
Sumner White had written twice from
Leonardville, rather long letters about the High
School Team, with messages from Dick’s former
schoolmates and questions about Parkinson football
methods. Sumner’s faith in Dick remained
unimpaired, although the latter had still to announce
his acceptance on the Parkinson First
Team. “We are all expecting big things from
you, Dick old scout,” wrote Sumner in his latest
epistle. “Cal Lensen is going to get the Parkinson
weekly to exchange with the <cite>Argus</cite> so he can
keep tabs on you. So just remember that we’re
watching you, kid! Every time you make a touchdown
for Parkinson the old <cite>Argus</cite> will have a
full and graphic account of it in the next number.
But you’d better write now and then, besides.
Good luck to you, Dick, and that goes for all the
‘gang.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>It wasn’t very easy to answer Sumner’s letters
because answering involved explaining why he
hadn’t made the team. But Dick did answer them.
The following Sunday he wrote: “Got your letter
Tuesday, but saved it for today because Sunday’s
about the only day a fellow has time here for
writing letters. Glad to get the news about everyone,
but very sorry to hear of the Chester game.
But you fellows must remember that Chester has
the edge on you, anyway. Look at their coach
and all the money they spend and all that! Besides,
19-6 isn’t as bad as we licked them two years
ago. I guess you’ll have to find someone for
Mercer’s place. Ed tries hard, but he isn’t
scrappy enough for full-back. You need a fellow
who isn’t afraid of a stone wall and doesn’t get
hurt the way Ed did all last year. What about
Cleary? He’s slow, I know, but you might speed
him up this year, and he has lots of fight....
Things here are humming along finely. We played
Musket Hill yesterday and just walked away with
them. I told you I didn’t fancy Driscoll, the
coach, but I like him better, and I guess he does
know how to get the stuff out of a team. Talking
about full-backs, I wish you could see our man
here in action. His name’s Kirkendall and he
comes from Kentucky. The fellows call him ‘K of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
K.’, or just ‘K’ sometimes. Well, he got
started yesterday in the third period on our forty
and Stone (quarter) fed him the ball eight times
and he landed it on N. H.’s seven yards, and he’d
have taken it over, too, if Stone hadn’t acted the
silly goat and switched to Warden. It took Warden
and Gaines both to get it over then, but they
did it. Only it seemed too bad not to let K. get the
credit for the touchdown after smashing all the
way for fifty yards. Stone doesn’t use his head,
it seems to me. But he does play a good individual
game. For all-round work, though, our captain,
Bob Peters, is the star of the team. He plays
right end, and he’s a wonder at it. Talk about getting
down under punts! Gee, Sum, he’s under
the ball from the minute it’s kicked, and he seems
to always know just where it’s going, too. But
he’s just as good on defence, and the way he
handled the opposing tackle yesterday was a marvel.
He’s a dandy captain, too, for all the fellows
swear by him and would do anything he asked
them to, I guess.</p>

<p>“I’m still pegging along on the outside, and
maybe I won’t make the team this year. There
are nearly five hundred students here and a lot of
them are corking football players and a fellow has
got to be mighty good to even get looked at by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
coach. So you mustn’t be surprised if you don’t
see my name in the <cite>Leader</cite> this year. Of course
it’s early yet, and I might have luck, but I’m not
counting on it much. I’m having a good time,
though. Some of the football chaps are corkers,
<em>big</em> fellows, you know. I mean big every way,
not only in size. They’re big enough in size,
though, believe me, Sum. Gee, I was certainly surprised
when I saw how the team stacked up. Why,
Newhall, the right guard, must weigh two hundred
pounds, and Cupp isn’t any light-weight either.
Another thing I was surprised at was the way they
go at football here. Everything’s all arranged
and cut out six months ahead and it’s the most
business-like proposition I ever saw. There’s an
Athletic Committee first, composed of three faculty
and two students, the football and baseball managers
usually. Then there’s the Head Coach, and
under him the trainer and his assistant. The committee
meets every week and then there’s a meeting
in the coach’s room every night but Sunday
and everything is threshed out and plans made
for the next day. There doesn’t seem to be a
moment wasted here. Just at first I thought it
was too professional or something, but I guess it’s
just being efficient. It works all right, anyway.
Well, I must stop and go over to see a fellow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the village with Stan. I’ll tell you about that fellow
some time. He’s a wonder! Remember me
to everyone and think over what I wrote about
Leary. I forgot to tell you the score yesterday.
It was 27-3. Some game, eh?”</p>

<p>Dick might have written a little more truthfully
that he wasn’t counting at all on making the First
Team, for at the end of the first fortnight at
Parkinson it was pretty evident to him that he had
still some distance to go before he would reach the
proficiency of fellows like Peters and Kirkendall
and Warden and several more. The fact that he
had loomed up as an uncommonly good quarter-back
at Leonardville High School, and that the
town papers had hailed him as a star of the first
magnitude, didn’t mean much to him here. He saw
that Parkinson and Leonardville standards were
widely apart. Why, there were fellows on the
Second Team here who were better than anything
Leonardville had ever seen! But Dick took his
disappointment philosophically. He meant to try
very hard for a place on the big eleven, no matter
how humble it might be, and so get in line for next
year. He wondered sometimes if he wouldn’t have
shown himself wiser had he gone out for the Second
Team instead. There was still time for that,
for very often candidates released from the First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Team squad went to the Second and made good,
but somehow he didn’t like the idea of trying for
the moon and being satisfied with a jack-o’-lantern!
No, he decided, if he failed at the First he
would quit for that year and try all the harder next.
Rumors of a first cut were about on the Monday
following the Musket Hill game, and Dick prepared
for retirement to private life. The cut didn’t
come, however, until Thursday, and when it did
come it passed Dick by. Why, he couldn’t make
out. Fellows like Macomber and Swift and Teasdale
disappeared and Dick remained. And Macomber
and the others were, in Dick’s estimation,
much better players than he. But he accepted his
good fortune and went on trying very hard to make
good, telling himself all the time that the next
cut would take him, certainly.</p>

<p>But if Dick’s success at football was in a measure
disappointing, his faculty for making friends
had not deserted him. He had acquired many by
the end of the first fortnight at school. Of course,
they were not all close friends, but they were
more than mere acquaintances. Among the close
friends he counted Stanley first. Then came Blash
and Sid and Rusty. His liking for Blash—and
Blash’s for him—seemed to have started after the
episode of the telephone call. Because Dick had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fooled Blash and Blash had taken it smilingly
seemed no good reason for an increase of friendship,
but there it was! Blash still threatened to get
even some day, and Dick was certain that he would,
but that only made the mutual liking stronger.
As between Sid Crocker and Rusty Crozier, Dick
would have had trouble saying which he liked the
better. Rusty was far more amusing, but Sid was
a dependable sort of chap. In trouble, Dick would
have thought first of Sid. Oddly enough, Dick’s
popularity was greater amongst fellows older than
he. Each of those whom he counted real friends
was at least a year his senior, and Harry Warden,
with whom acquaintanceship was fast warming
into friendship, was nearly two years older. But
the disparity in age was not greatly apparent, for
Dick had the growth and manners of eighteen
rather than seventeen, and one who didn’t know
the truth might well have thought him as old as
either Stanley or Rusty.</p>

<p>Of enemies, so far as he knew, Dick had made
but one. Sanford Halden allowed no opportunity
to remind Dick of his enmity to get past him.
He had been among those dropped from the First
Team squad in that first cut and it appeared that
he somehow managed to hold Dick to blame for
that. When they passed in hall or on campus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Sandy always had a malevolent scowl for him,
and once or twice Dick thought he even heard mutters!
All this Dick found mildly amusing. Sandy
reminded him of a villain in a cheap melodrama.
A few days after the cut Dick heard that Sandy
had attached himself to the Second Nine for fall
practice.</p>

<p>Football took up a great deal of Dick’s time
and much of his thought, but he managed to maintain
an excellent standing in each of his courses
and thus won the liking of most of the instructors
with whom he came in contact. With Mr. Matthews,
who was Dick’s advisor, he was soon on
close terms of intimacy. The instructor was one
of the younger faculty members, a man with a
sympathetic understanding of boys, and tastes that
included most of the things that boys liked. He
had a passion for athletics and was one of the
Nine’s most unflagging rooters. But for all this
he was not generally liked. The younger boys,
who formed most of his classes, were suspicious
of his fashion of regarding them individually instead
of as a whole. They declared, some of them
at least, that he “crowded” them. By which, in
school parlance, was meant that he tried to be too
friendly. They resented his attempts to interest
himself in their doings outside classes. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the older boys, however, he was a prime favourite,
and his study in Williams was the scene of Friday
evening “parties” that were always well attended.
Anyone was welcome. There was much talk, the
subjects ranging from the value of the “spitball”
in pitching to the influence of Bible study on literary
style. At nine o’clock ginger ale and cookies—the
latter especially made by a woman in the
town and transferred each Friday from her house
to the school in a laundry box by Mr. Matthews—were
served. Perhaps some of the guests were
present more on account of the ginger ale and molasses
cookies than for any other reason, for the
cookies had long since gained a wide fame, but
none questioned their motives.</p>

<p>Stanley and Dick attended one of the parties the
Friday following the Musket Hill game. There
were more than a dozen fellows already in the
room when they arrived, most of whom Stanley
knew and a few of whom were known to Dick.
All the usual seating accommodation being exhausted,
the instructor had dragged his bed to the
door of the adjoining room, and on the edge of
that the newcomers found places, they and a spectacled
youth named Timmins completely filling the
doorway. Conversation was still general. Mr.
Matthews, dropping a word now and then into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
noisy confusion, was at his study table cutting
sheets of paper into quarters with a pair of shears.
He wasn’t a bit impressive, being under rather
than over medium height and slight of build. He
had light hair that was already thin over the forehead,
bluish eyes and light lashes, all of which gave
him a somewhat colourless appearance. But there
was an inquiring tilt to the short nose, a humorous
droop at the corners of the mouth and a very determined
protrusion of the chin that lent interest
to the countenance.</p>

<p>The study was a comfortable sort of place. The
woodwork was painted mahogany brown and there
was a lightish buff paper on the walls and many
books in the low cases and a few really good engravings
above. The furniture was old, rather
dilapidated and most friendly. Even the chairs
whose backs were straightest and whose seats
looked most uncompromising had acquired unsuspected
and hospitable curves. There was a deep
red rug, rather a good rug it was if you knew
anything about Mousuls, and a “saddle-bag” was
stretched along the window-seat. Just now the
latter was hidden by four of the guests.</p>

<p>Mr. Matthews dropped the shears and rapped
for attention. “Before we settle the affairs of nations,
fellows, as is our weekly custom,” he announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in his pleasant and somewhat precise
voice, “I propose that we spend a half-hour in
mere recreation. This particular form of recreation
is not original with me. I ran across it in
the summer. Half a dozen of us were trying to
live through the third day of a northeast storm
down on the Maine coast. We’d exhausted every
known means of staving off imbecility when one
of the party, he happened to be a clergyman, by
the way, introduced—should I say ‘sprung,’ Harris?—sprung
this on us. ‘There are three things,’
he said, ‘that every man firmly believes he can do.
One is run a hotel, another is conduct a newspaper
and the third is write poetry.’ He proposed that
we should write poetry. We tried, and the results,
if not calculated to win us undying fame, were at
least amusing. Suppose, then, we try the same
stunt this evening. Here are some pencils and
two fountain pens. You are respectfully requested
to leave the pens behind when you go out. The
pencils I leave to your consciences. And here are
some sheets of paper. Ford, would you mind distributing
to those behind you? And you, McEwen?
Thank you. Now the idea is to choose the surname
of one of the party and write a two-line
verse, the first line ending with the—er—victim’s
name. Want to try it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” “We’ll try anything once!” “My
middle name is Tennyson, Mr. Matthews!”</p>

<p>“All right. And for the one who writes what is
voted to be the best effusion, there is a prize concealed
in this drawer here.”</p>

<p>Loud applause from the assemblage, and an inquiry
from the window-seat: “Please may we see
it first, sir?”, followed by more applause and
laughter.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Neal, but the prize is not to be seen
until won. I want you to really try! To illustrate
the style of composition to be followed, I give you
this, gentlemen, craving your indulgence. It is
one of my attempts on the occasion mentioned. I
ran across it the other day and it gave me the idea
of trying the game this evening. In explanation
I may say that the gentleman mentioned was a
super-excellent golf player and very, very thin as
to body.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Fore! Fore! Here comes the devastating Felton,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">To all opponents “The Inhuman Skel’ton”!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">The rhyme is obviously of the licensed sort! But
you get the idea, don’t you? Now, let’s select a
name. Which shall we start with?”</p>

<p>“Ford, sir. That’s easy,” someone suggested.</p>

<p>“Very well. Three minutes is allowed. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the time is up I’ll call ‘Time’ and you will at once
stop. Ready? Everyone supplied with pencil and
paper?”</p>

<p>“All set!” “Let ’er go, sir!”</p>

<p>“Now!” said Mr. Matthews, his eyes on his
watch. The laughter was stilled and fifteen pens
or pencils were poised over as many sheets of
paper. Then mutters arose and feet shuffled.
“Say, what rhymes with ‘Ford’?” asked Timmins
of Stanley in an audible whisper. Chuckles
arose and De Vitt answered, “‘Flivver,’ Tim!”
Dick was still struggling when the time was up and
his second line was lacking a rhyme.</p>

<p>“Now we will read the results in turn,” said
Mr. Matthews. “Suppose you begin, Harris.”</p>

<p>“Not prepared, sir,” answered “Tip” Harris.</p>

<p>Three others answered to the same effect and it
was Cashin who bashfully produced the first composition,
as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Apollo had nothing on Goody Ford.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He’s cross-eyed and lantern-jawed.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Ingenious,” commented Mr. Matthews, when
the laughter had stopped, “but rather a libel on
Ford. You’re next, Elders.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get mine done, sir. I think your watch
was fast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“How about you, Gard?”</p>

<p>“Guess you might as well open that drawer,
sir!” And Stanley read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He seeks no prize, does Goody Ford,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For virtue is its own reward.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That won much applause, for Ford, whose appellation
of “Goody,” derived from his given name
of Goodman, was no indication of his behaviour,
had scorned to take part in the competition. Two
other verses were read and then a second name
was chosen. This time it was Cashin, and nearly
everyone turned in something. The best of them,
if applause was any indication, was Neal’s:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I sing the praise of our Beau Cashin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The latest cry in mode and fashion.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“That rhyme requires a license, too, Neal,”
laughed Mr. Matthews. “I might say, fellows, that
it isn’t absolutely necessary to ‘knock’!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” agreed De Vitt, “but it’s easier!”</p>

<p>Which rejoinder brought De Vitt into the limelight,
and his name was tried next. Gerald De
Vitt was editor-in-chief of the school weekly, <cite>The
Leader</cite>, a likable fellow who took himself a bit
seriously, who wrote long, sensible and very dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
editorials, and who mistakenly conducted a column
of allegedly humorous matter that was the despair
of his friends. Consequently when Stanley read
his production the howl of laughter that arose
held as much applause as amusement.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here in our circle frowns the grave De Vitt,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Revered as Mentor and deplored as Wit!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later someone suggested trying “Matthews”
and there were many dismal failures and just one
quasi-success. The latter was Dick’s.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Though anger may assail our Matthews<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His cheek ne’er shows the sanguine wrath hues.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the end it was Stanley’s couplet on De Vitt
that was voted the prize and Mr. Matthews gravely
opened the desk drawer and as gravely presented
the fortunate contestant with a large red apple! It
was quite the largest apple any of them had ever
seen, and, while it was passed around, the instructor
explained that it was one of a plate of prize-winners
at the County Fair. At Stanley’s request
a knife was produced and the apple was divided
into sixteen pieces and distributed. Mr. Matthews
brought out the “spread” and for an hour longer
the gathering munched delectable cookies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
drank ginger ale and talked. On the whole, the
occasion was a very enjoyable one, and Dick determined
that hereafter his Friday evenings
should be spent in Number 2 Williams. And, although
he missed a “party” now and then, he kept
that promise to himself fairly well.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>WHITEWASHED!</small></h2>


<p>Parkinson played Cumner High School the next
afternoon. Cumner was a nearby town of some
eight or nine thousand inhabitants set in the middle
of a prosperous farming community. The
Cumner teams were made up largely of very hefty
sons of the soil, averaging slightly older than
Parkinson’s representatives and invariably out-weighing
them. As a rule Parkinson won because
of better knowledge of the game and greater speed.
She called Cumner’s players The Farmers, but
she did it with much respect and liking, knowing
which Cumner took no exception to the title. In
fact, the Cumner Football Team was one of a few
that invariably received as hearty a welcome when
it trotted onto Parkinson Field as did the brown-and-white
eleven. Its members were big, manly,
hard-playing chaps who took defeat gallantly and
victory modestly.</p>

<p>Dick, of course, was not vitally interested in
that game and as he was not required to report in
togs today he and Stanley and Sid watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
contest from seats in a stand. Cumner showed up
unusually formidable during the ten or fifteen minutes
of practice that preceded the contest, and Sid,
who, although a baseball man, knew football very
thoroughly, predicted trouble ahead for the
Brown-and-White.</p>

<p>“That’s the heaviest team they’ve sent over
since I’ve been here,” commented Sid, “and they
don’t look nearly as slow as they generally do.
And that black-headed giant down there hasn’t
missed a goal yet, although he’s tried some fierce
angles. No, sir, Parkinson isn’t going to have any
old walk-away this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t pile up more than twenty points,
maybe,” said Stanley. “Sometimes we don’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and sometimes we just squeak through,
as we did two years ago. Seven-six it was that
time. I remember I had heart disease when Sinclair
got ready to try that goal. And then he
wouldn’t have made it if the ball had gone six
inches further to the right.”</p>

<p>“You don’t play football!” asked Dick. “I
mean, you never have?”</p>

<p>“No.” Sid shook his head. “I’ve always
preferred baseball. I suppose I like it better because
it gives more chance for individual work.
Of course, if you’re a backfield player in football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
you have more show to work ‘on your own,’ but a
lineman’s a good deal like a piece of machinery;
the more he’s like it the better he is. Now in
baseball——”</p>

<p>“He’s off!” groaned Stanley. “You shouldn’t
have got him started, Dick. He’s good for an
hour now!”</p>

<p>But Sid’s exposition of the advantages of baseball
over the rival game was interrupted by the
referee’s whistle and the thud of “Babe” Upton’s
toe against the ball. Parkinson had put in what
was to date her strongest line-up: Furniss, Harris,
Cupp, Upton, Newhall, Wendell, Peters,
Stone, Gaines, Warden and Kirkendall. Opposed
to them were eleven heavier and yet apparently
rangy youths. Even the Cumner quarter-back
must have tipped the scales at a hundred and
fifty, and the ends were unusually weighty for
their positions. But Cumner soon showed that
weight and speed may go together. The kick-off
fell on her twenty-yard line, was seized by a long-legged
back and, with the team closing in ahead
of him, the back ran straight ahead for fifteen
yards before he was downed. Bob Peters had
followed the short kick closely, but even Bob
couldn’t penetrate the close defence until three
white lines had been crossed by the runner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Three plays took the ball out of the danger
zone and Cumner opened up with a dazzling forward-pass
that put the ball well beyond the centre
of the field. After that a penalty set her back and
she was forced to punt. But three minutes later
the ball was hers again, for Kirkendall, tackled on
an end run, had dropped it and a Cumner youth
had fallen on it. Again came a forward, this
time far and swift, and Furniss, watching the
wrong opponent, saw the pigskin settle into the
hands of the Cumner right half. It was Stone
who chased the runner out of bounds on Parkinson’s
twenty-six yards.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” marvelled
Sid.</p>

<p>“You tell me,” said Stanley.</p>

<p>“Sure I will! I’ll tell you that I smell a score,
sonny!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll hold ’em off, all right. They won’t
try any more forwards. Watch them crack
against our line.”</p>

<p>But Cumner didn’t crack. At least, she managed
to make her distance in four and arrived at
the Brown-and-White’s fifteen-yard line to the
surprised dismay of the home rooters. The
Parkinson left had been twice punctured for respectable
gains and twice Cumner had slashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a path outside right tackle. Cumner had evolved
a very satisfactory method for bottling Captain
Peters, using a tackle, brought across from the
other side of her line, and a back for the purpose.
But, although the hundred or more Cumner supporters
yelled in triumph and a touchdown seemed
imminent, Parkinson for the time staved off a
score. Two straight plunges at the left of her
centre gained only two yards, and the Cumner
right half walked back to kicking position. The
angle, however, was difficult and few looked for
a bona fide attempt at a field-goal. Consequently
the short forward-pass that followed, from the
Cumner right half directly across the centre of
the line, didn’t catch the home team napping.
Gaines intercepted it and went plunging back into
the mêlée and made seven yards before he was
stopped. Parkinson punted on first down and the
ball was Cumner’s on her forty-six.</p>

<p>Stanley taunted Sid with the failure of his prediction.
“Where’s that score, you old gloom?” he
demanded. “Dick, I don’t want to say anything
that might be construed into a criticism of our
mutual friend, Mr. Crocker, but I must remark
that he’s a bum prophet.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” answered Sid soberly.
“That score’s coming and it’s coming mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
soon. Those farmers have found someone to
teach them football. They know the game. Watch
them for the next five minutes, Stan, and then tell
me if I’m a bum prophet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you so now,” replied Stanley cheerfully.
“I don’t have to wait five minutes. Say
what are those hayseeds up to? What sort of a
silly stunt is that?”</p>

<p>Cumner had stretched her line across the field
in a weird formation indeed. A horse and wagon
might have easily been driven between any two of
her linemen. Quite alone stooped the centre, the
quarter eight yards behind him and the other backs
apparently no longer interested in anything he
might do. To meet this scattering of forces
Parkinson likewise spread out, but she did it less
whole-heartedly, keeping her centre trio pretty
close together. Her backs adopted the “basket
formation” well behind the line, for it seemed that
Cumner’s queer arrangement of her players must
portend some novel type of forward-passing. Yet,
when centre lined the ball back to the quarter,
nothing extremely novel developed. The outspread
line dashed forward straight toward the opponent’s
goal and the quarter, delaying a moment,
sped off at a slight angle, the ball cupped in his
arm. To his support came two backs. But Parkinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
after a brief second of hesitation, concentrated
on the oncoming trio, and, although Cumner
netted six yards on the play, the Brown-and-White’s
adherents howled ironically. That even
six yards had been gained was merely because
Parkinson had refused to believe her eyes and had
waited too long before going in. Another time,
jeered Stanley, they’d be lucky to get an inch!</p>

<p>Cumner tried her full-back against Parkinson’s
right and lost two of the six she had won. This
was from ordinary formation, as was her next attempt
to skirt Bob Peter’s end. On the latter play
she made a scant yard. Then, while Parkinson
rooters laughed and hooted in good-natured derision,
Cumner again broke her line apart. What
followed this time, however, was far different.
When the ball was shot back to the quarter the
Parkinson centre trio made straight for that
youth, bowling the centre out of their path. The
quarter seemed to the onlookers unusually slow
and even at a loss, for after a moment of hesitation
he made a tentative stride to the right,
stopped, faced the attack undecidedly and then
dashed away at a surprising speed toward the
right side of the field. A back had already shot
off in that direction and was some fifteen yards
beyond the quarter when the latter, deftly eluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the Parkinson left tackle, whirled, stopped and
shot the ball away at a lateral pass. Parkinson
had unconsciously drawn in toward the quarter-back,
even her left half having wandered from his
position, and when the Cumner half, catching the
pass neatly, again threw the ball forward there
was none near the receiver. The latter was the
Cumner right end who had, almost unseen, trotted
down the field just inside the boundary. <a href="#image01">That
second pass was fairly high and it seemed that
Kirkendall would reach the receiver in time to
spoil it</a>, but he didn’t quite succeed. The best he
could do was give chase along the edge of the field
and, at the last, defeat the effort of that speedy
Cumner right end to centre the ball behind the
Parkinson goal. Stone, too, was in the race, but,
like the full-back, never reached the runner until
the line had been crossed.</p>

<p>Cumner’s supporters went wild with joy, and
long after the pigskin had been punted out from
the corner of the gridiron to a waiting left guard,
their howls and cheers arose from across the field.
Sid forebore to say “I told you so,” but Stanley
sadly apologised. “I retract what I said, Sid,”
he stated dolefully. “You’re not a bum prophet.
You’re a prophetic bum!”</p>

<p>Cumner kicked goal easily after the punt-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and when the ball had again sailed through the
air the first quarter ended. That twelve-minute
period, however, spelled ultimate disaster for the
home team, for although Cumner did not score
again, Parkinson failed to score at all! Twice she
came near to it, once in the second quarter and
once in the third. In the second she slammed her
way to Cumner’s seven yards, lost ten yards on a
penalty, and failed of a field-goal by inches only.
In the third period she reached her opponent’s
four yards only to have Kirkendall’s last effort
fail by a scant six inches. That was bitter medicine
to the Brown-and-White, and after that failure all
the fight seemed to have gone out of her. In the
final period, with many substitutes in, she showed
some life, to be sure, but there wasn’t punch
enough left to make her dangerous, and Cumner,
still playing with her first line-up practically intact,
kicked out of danger whenever it threatened.</p>

<p>Going back to the campus after Cumner, cheering
and singing, had marched triumphantly under
the goals, Sid predicted a shake-up in the team.
“You can’t tell me,” he said, “that we had any
right to get licked today. That flukey play of
Cumner’s that got them their score may have been
unpreventable, although I don’t think so, but
where we fell down hard was in that third period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
when K couldn’t get across. It isn’t allowable
for a Parkinson team to get to the four yards and
not get over. It isn’t done among the best Parkinson
teams!”</p>

<p>“I thought,” observed Dick, “that Kirkendall
should have been sent around tackle on that last
play. We’d hammered their centre three times
and they were looking for us to do it again and
they’d massed their whole secondary defence behind
it. Seems to me——”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” agreed Sid. “Give ’em what
they aren’t expecting, is my motto. Stone ought
to have kept them guessing. His idea, I suppose,
was that if he hammered the centre long enough it
would weaken. Even their backs couldn’t have
stopped a score if the line had busted, Dick. You
see, we needed only a yard at the last and we’d
have got it if their centre had weakened a bit
more. It’s easy to criticise from the grand-stand,
but it’s likely that Stone knew more than we did
about those fellows he was facing. He probably
had good reason to think he could smash K
through there. Must have or he wouldn’t have
persisted the way he did. Well, we’ll have
to do better next week or we’ll get a good
trouncing.”</p>

<p>“Phillipsburg?” asked Stan. “Yes, that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
so. We play them on their grounds, too, and that
makes a difference. Hang it, I wish we’d tried a
goal from the field that last time. Even three
points would be something! It looks like the dickens
to have those farmers whitewash us! We
haven’t been whitewashed for ages!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we needed it, then,” chuckled Sid.
“But you know Bob Peters well enough to be certain
he wouldn’t be satisfied with three points
when he might get seven. Not Bob! He’d want
to win or tie. Just getting a consolation prize
wouldn’t appeal to him, Stan.”</p>

<p>“It would to me, then,” muttered Stan. “You
going to Phillipsburg?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. We’ve got a sort of a game on
Saturday with Warne High School. It doesn’t
amount to much; six innings and we to use second-string
pitchers; but it’s likely to be about the last
chance of the season to try some real work. You
expect to go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What about it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to. Is it much of a trip?”</p>

<p>“No, a couple of hours. I’ll go if you do, I
guess. Got any money?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll stake you. Will many of the fellows
go?”</p>

<p>“A lot,” answered Sid. “I think Blash intends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
going. Well, see you later, fellows. We’ll be over
about seven.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” exclaimed Stanley joyfully.
“This is movie night! Oh, you Douglas Hart!
Oh, you Bill Fairbanks! So long, Sid!”</p>

<small>WARDEN ADVISES</small></h2>


<p>The shake-up predicted by Sid didn’t come, although
several experimental changes were tried in
the line-up the next week. Dick learned from
Cardin that Coach Driscoll had taken a large share
of the responsibility for that defeat, declaring
that he should have supplied the team with a better
defence for the one-man pass. Dick and Cardin
had taken to each other and, during scrimmage
when Stone was running the First Team against
the Second, usually sat together on the bench. In
a measure they were rivals, but Cardin was second-choice
quarter and Dick—well, Dick was so far
down on the list that his number didn’t matter.
Stone, Cardin and Pryne were the quarters who
would be depended on this season, and Dick sometimes
wondered why he and two other aspirants
were retained. But they were, at least until the
Friday of that week. Then Dick alone remained
and could flatter himself if he chose to with the
title of fourth-string quarter-back! With the
passing of the two superfluous quarters came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
elimination of a half-dozen assorted candidates
and the First Team was down to less than forty
players.</p>

<p>It had been decided that Dick and Stanley, Blash
and Rusty were to accompany the team to Phillipsburg
on Saturday, and, when that day arrived, go
they did. But they didn’t go together, for on
Friday afternoon, after the players were back in
the locker room in the gymnasium, Manager
Whipple read the names of the thirty-one fellows
who were to report at eleven the next forenoon,
and lo, the list began in this surprising
manner:</p>

<p>“Abbott, Abernathy, Banker, Bates——”</p>

<p>So Stanley, Blash and Rusty Crozier travelled
to Phillipsburg in the twelve-ten accommodation,
while Dick, one of a small army of players, coaches,
trainers, rubbers and managers, departed in style
at eleven-forty on the Springfield Express which,
for that occasion only, was scheduled to stop at
Phillipsburg at twelve-fifty-four. They walked to
the station, each with his togs in a bag, and presented
a fairly formidable army as they marched
by twos and threes down School Street. Small
boys stood spellbound in awed admiration and
elderly citizens smiled or frowned according to
their sympathies: for Warne is still a somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
old-fashioned town and there were still those who
looked with disfavour on the rude sport of football.</p>

<p>At the station Billy Goode and his assistants
were waiting beside a baggage truck piled high
with paraphernalia, and the assistant manager,
who, as he would become manager next year, must
learn his trade by serving an apprenticeship to
which fell the hard work, was standing nearby
importantly frowning over an envelope full of
round-trip tickets. He had counted the contents
of the envelope three times and had got a different
result with each count. Stearns Whipple relieved
him of further responsibility by pocketing the
tickets uncounted while the assistant dug up the
balance of the eighty dollars entrusted to him.
The express came in twelve minutes late—being
late was a long-standing habit of the express—and
they piled aboard. Seats were few and Dick was
among the dozen or more who were forced to
stand or sit on their up-ended suit-cases in the
aisle. At the first stop after Warne, however,
Dick and Warden were lucky enough to fall heirs
to the seat of an elderly couple nearby who for
twenty minutes had displayed intense bewilderment
over the somewhat boisterous horde of boys
who had invaded the car. Dick thought he read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
intense relief on the prim countenance of the old
lady as she left.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if Mr. Driscoll used
you today, Bates,” said Warden when they were
speeding on again. “I have an idea that it’s been
decided to put in a practically fresh line-up in the
second half. No one cares an awful lot whether
we win from Phillipsburg, and it’s about time
some of the second-string fellows got a good tryout.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a second-string fellow,” demurred
Dick.</p>

<p>“N-no, but I think he means to give all his
backs a whack at it this afternoon. If you do get
in, old man, just keep your head steady. Don’t
let anything or anyone rattle you. If you look out
for that you’ll make good, I guess. Another thing,
Bates. Don’t be afraid of hustling the team. A
team likes to work fast. It’s the waits between
plays that raise the dickens sometimes. Keep
us going. And talk it up a lot. That helps, even
if it does sound crazy on the side-lines. Scold, too,
but don’t nag. Stone nags too much. And Cardin
doesn’t whoop it up enough. I tell you, Bates, a
fellow likes to feel that his quarter is right on the
job, that he isn’t missing a trick and that he’s
standing by every minute. I don’t know if I make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
myself quite clear. But, for instance, when I’m
playing I like to feel that all I’ve got to do is
mind the quarter, that he knows what he’s doing.
I want to have implicit confidence in my quarter.
Then I can play ball. If I don’t have confidence I
can’t. I get to thinking: What’s he mean by
that? That isn’t the play for the down. Suppose
he’s mixed on his signals: Is the ball going
to be there when I’m ready? And I lose confidence
in my own ability to make the play good.</p>

<p>“Last year we had Patterson. He was a wonder,
my idea of just what a quarter should be. If
it was fourth down on the other fellow’s one-yard
and Billy called for a punt we’d have thought it
all right. Not one of us would have questioned.
He didn’t make mistakes and we knew it. I say
he didn’t make mistakes, but of course he did once
in a while. He was only human, you know. He
pulled an awful ‘boner’ in the Chancellor game.
He had called the ‘big shift’ and then he sent K
around the wrong end and we lost about six yards;
and a touchdown, too, as it proved, for we couldn’t
make the distance afterwards. Of course we were
pretty sore and we’d have said some hard things
just then to anyone but Billy. You might expect
a quarter after doing a stunt like that to be all
broke-up, but when I got on my feet again Billy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was laughing for all he was worth. ‘That’s the
worst one I ever pulled,’ said he. ‘I guess the
old bean’s slipping, fellows!’ So, in about one
second we were all laughing, too, and calling it a
joke. But Billy’s old bean didn’t slip very often,
I’m telling you.”</p>

<p>“Did you win that game, Warden?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! We got over the next try all right.
I forget the score. Something like three scores
to one, I think. But if Billy had got sore we’d
have all been sore, and being sore doesn’t help
much. Unless you’re sore against the other team.
A quarter wants to be a regular double-dyed
optimist, Bates, and he wants to let everyone
know it, for the rest of the team will take their
cue from him. Just let them think that he’s discouraged
and they’ll feel the same way, and as
soon as they do they’ll quit trying their hardest.
They won’t mean to, mind you, but they will.
There’s a lot of psychology in a football game,
old man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that’s so,” agreed Dick. “Where
I’ve played, back home, though, it’s always been
the captain that’s run things, Warden.”</p>

<p>“Bad business. A captain shouldn’t butt in on
the running of the team unless it’s absolutely imperative.
He has a position to play and he ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to give his whole mind to playing it. You watch
Bob. You’ll almost never see him question a
signal or even suggest a play. You can’t have
two bosses, Bates, and a quarter-back is in position
to see what’s going on and to dope out the
answer. Sometimes Bob will guess what the other
fellow is up to and let us know, and he’s usually
right, too, but that’s about all he does except play
his position. Off the field he’s the Big Boss, but
on it he’s taking his orders from the quarter just
like the rest of us. I’m doing a lot of talking, but
I’ve got rather strong convictions as to the proper
playing of the quarter-back position, Bates, and I
thought I’d hand them on. Even if you don’t like
’em there’s no harm done.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you have, Warden,” said Dick earnestly.
“I’d never thought much about the—what
you call the psychology of the thing. But I
see that you’re right. And I’ll keep it in mind—if
I ever get a chance!”</p>

<p>“Oh, your chance will come before the season’s
over. Mr. Driscoll isn’t keeping you on the
squad just to look at. Bates, I’ve seen a whole
team pretty nearly turned upside down between
the first game and the last, seen fellows who supposedly
never had a chance come out of the big
game covered with medals. You never can tell!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Well, next stop’s ours, I think. I’m as hungry as a
bear. I hope they give us a good feed at the
hotel. Two years ago we nearly starved.”</p>

<p>Phillipsburg didn’t impress Dick very favourably
at the first glance for the sunlight of a gorgeous
October day was almost obscured by a pall
of smoke from the many factories along the railway.
But later, when they had left the station
behind and were trudging up the hill toward the
centre of the city, the smoke disappeared and
Phillipsburg turned out to be rather attractive.
The hotel was one of those old-fashioned hostelries
set close to the street, with a broad verandah running
along the front on which gentlemen of leisure
sat tilted back in their chairs and watched life go
by. To the loungers the arrival of thirty-odd
guests in one bunch was a refreshingly momentous
event, doubtless affording them more real excitement
than they had experienced since the last collision
or runaway. Quite a number of them abandoned
their ease and comfort and followed the
end of the procession into the lobby to satisfy their
curiosity.</p>

<p>Dinner—or luncheon as it really was—was
served in a small and very musty smelling room
on the second floor, a room evidently dedicated to
the yearly banquets of the Odd Fellows and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
annual conclave of the local Order of White Elephants.
There was a faded red carpet on the
floor and three long walnut tables were arranged
around as many sides of a square. The chairs
matched the tables and dated back to about the
period of the Hayes and Tilden campaign. But
the food wasn’t bad and the two coloured waiters,
in spite of the infirmities of age, managed to get
it to the table fairly hot.</p>

<p>After the meal was finished Coach Driscoll
explained the plans for the afternoon game.
Phillipsburg Academy had a light-weight and
supposedly speedy team that relied on passing
and running more than on line-smashing. Her
punters were exceptionally good and her ends
fast. To meet the Phillipsburg style of offence
Parkinson would play her ends back and her
tackles out, with Stone and Warden dividing the
field. Phillipsburg made use of both the “bunch”
and the “one-man” pass and used a lateral pass
as well. If Phillipsburg switched her attack to
the centre of the line, the Parkinson tackles were
to come in again, but there were always to be two
men up the field. On attack the Brown-and-White
was to try out several new running plays and to
use the forward-pass whenever practical inside
the neutral zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got a good chance, fellows,” said Mr.
Driscoll, “to try out our passing and end-running
plays against a team who has a scientific defence
against them. If we make our passes go we’ll
have reason to be a bit satisfied with ourselves,
for Phillipsburg has worked out a pretty good defence
against the passing game. What she can do
to stop end-runs remains to be seen. But you’ve
got to start quick today and run hard and watch
the holes, you backs. You’ve got to show about
twice the speed you showed against Cumner last
week. If you don’t, these chaps will make you look
mighty poor.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see that every fellow has a look-in
at some time during the game. We may lose
the game, but we’re going to get experience.
Mind, I’m not saying we shall lose it or that we
ought to, because I don’t think for a moment that
Phillipsburg is a bit better than we are, even if
we use third-string players. If you’ll use your
heads today, and play as fast as you know how,
you’ll come out on top. I want to see that Number
12 play go smoothly today. It’s a winner if
you pull it right, but you’ve got to get together
on it. All right. Any questions, fellows?”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they crowded into two yellow
trolley cars and went bouncing and swaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
out toward the Academy, a mile from town. Dick
had held a few hurried words with Stanley and
Blash in the lobby. Rusty, it seemed, had disappeared
while they had been having lunch in a
white-enamelled place down the block and hadn’t
turned up since. “He’s probably up to some
idiotic tomfoolery,” grumbled Stanley, “and we’ll
have to go to the police station later and bail him
out, I suppose. Well, good luck, Dick! Hope you
get into it. If you do, remember the Maine and all
that sort of thing!”</p>

<p>The squad changed into football togs in a room
assigned to their use in the Academy gymnasium
and at a few minutes past two went across the elm-shaded
school yard to the athletic field beyond.
A tall youth with an embarrassed manner and a
prominent Adam’s apple, the assistant manager
of the Phillipsburg team, personally conducted
them. The game was scheduled for half-past two
and already the stands were well sprinkled with
spectators. A cheering section of some hundred
or so Parkinsonians was already in place and the
Brown-and-White trotted onto the field to a quite
noisy reception. Three squads took the gridiron
for signal drill and the punters got busy. Dick
accompanied the latter and punted and caught for
a good fifteen minutes, getting rather warm during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the proceedings. Phillipsburg arrived at two-twenty
and hustled out for a warming-up. By that
time the stands were about filled and the cheering
was on in earnest. Then the teams retired to
their benches, the captains met in midfield, shook
hands and watched the flicking of a coin, and Bob
Peters waved toward the south goal.</p>

<p>“Means we won the toss,” commented Jerry
Wendell, right tackle. “Well, here goes!” Dick
laid strong hands on Wendell’s sweater and the
latter squirmed out like a moth from a chrysalis.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE PHILLIPSBURG GAME</small></h2>


<p>There were not as many in attendance at the
game as was usual at Parkinson, although Phillipsburg
was a fair-sized city and Warne only an overgrown
town. Perhaps the fact that Phillipsburg
Academy was a very long mile from the city had
something to do with the meagreness of the audience.
At all events, aside from the rival cheering
sections the stands showed long empty stretches,
and Cardin, who shared an end of the bench with
Dick, resented it.</p>

<p>“Guess they must think this is a practice game,”
he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Driscoll seems to think so, too,”
said Dick. “He says we’re all to have a show
before it’s over.”</p>

<p>“He’ll forget that, though,” replied the other
pessimistically, “when we need a score to tie or
something. Coaches are always making cracks
like that and then forgetting ’em. Bet you I won’t
get in, Bates, and bet you you won’t.”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head. “I might bet about you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
but I wouldn’t wager an old straw hat on my
chances. Still, he <em>said</em> we would. There we go!”</p>

<p>Long, who was at right half, had pulled down
the home team’s kick-off and started across the
field with the ball, but the advance was short-lived,
for a speedy Phillipsburg end soon had him, and
it was Parkinson’s ball on her twenty-two yards.</p>

<p>Kirkendall shot through the enemy left for three
and then lost half the distance on a similar attempt.
Stone punted to the Phillipsburg forty, a
high kick that found both Peters and Furniss
waiting when it came down. The catcher was
downed in his tracks. Phillipsburg started in
merrily with a twenty-yard pass diagonally across
her line, but Peters smashed it aside and the ball
went back. A second forward, this time to the
opposite side, grounded, for Warden had run the
receiver far out of position. Phillipsburg stabbed
the Parkinson centre once in a half-hearted way
and got a bare four feet and then punted. The
ball, rising near the thirty yards, corkscrewed
beautifully down to the opposite thirty-five where
Warden got it but was stopped immediately. On
the exchange Parkinson had gained ten yards.
Kirkendall smashed the centre and got two, Warden
added three and Stone again punted.</p>

<p>This time he managed a better ball, for it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
both height and distance and was nicely placed in
the left-hand corner of the field. With Peters and
Furniss both on his heels, the Phillipsburg quarter
made no attempt to catch, and it was Furniss who
finally seized the bounding oval and downed it on
the enemy’s twenty-seven. Phillipsburg split her
line and shot the quarter through on a tricky dash
that fooled the opponent nicely. When the quarter
was stopped he had reeled off twelve yards and
the ball was close to the boundary. The Phillipsburg
rooters cheered lustily. An attempt to advance
on the short side was foiled and the ball
was paced in. On second down Phillipsburg was
caught off-side and set back. A run half across
the field netted but four yards and Phillipsburg
punted from near her thirty-five, the ball going out
at the visitor’s forty.</p>

<p>Kirkendall got clean away on the first run from
kick formation and, with excellent interference,
put eighteen yards behind him. Long was stopped
and Warden made three. Kirkendall, again called
on, tried left tackle and managed to make three
more. Stone again punted.</p>

<p>On the side-line Coach Driscoll was frowning
intently. Dick, noting, thought he understood.
He had heard the final instructions in the gymnasium
and recalled the coach’s words distinctly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
“Keep out of their line, Stone, until you’re certain
you can’t get your distance any other way.”
Now Stone seemed to have forgotten those instructions,
for not once had a forward-pass been tried,
while at least a half-dozen plays had been aimed
inside the Phillipsburg tackles. Dick didn’t see
what Bob Peters had gained by giving the kick-off
to the enemy and then promptly punting the ball
back into her hands, nor what Stone’s idea was
in kicking regularly on third down, irrespective
of the distance lacking. However, it was possible
that Stone had something up his sleeve, and when
Phillipsburg had failed at a well-tried “bunch”
forward and been stopped at the opponent’s left
end and had punted to mid-field, Dick looked for
another forward-pass. But it didn’t materialise.
Instead, Stone tried a delayed pass and got away
with the ball very neatly along the left side. But
an obstreperous Phillipsburg lineman wormed
through and nailed him short of any gain. Kirkendall
again retired to kicking position and, with
the ball snuggled, shot off at a tangent for the
enemy’s right. But the play worked less well this
time. The interference was split and a Phillipsburg
half nailed Kirkendall three yards past the
line. Then the delayed forward-pass came and
Warden tossed across to Peters. Peters tipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the throw but lost it. Again Stone punted, this
time making a miserable failure of it and landing
the ball but twenty yards away. It descended in
the midst of a pushing crowd of opponents, leaped
toward the side-line and was finally landed a few
feet away.</p>

<p>For another three or four minutes the play hovered
about midfield, neither side showing any indication
of a consistent attack, and then the whistle
blew. Coach Corliss summoned Cardin to him.
Dick watched them in conversation a bit enviously.
Then Cardin sped on, followed by Bartlett, a right
guard, and Gross, a left tackle.</p>

<p>When play began again Stone was somewhat
dourly looking on from the bench and Cardin was
in command. Phillipsburg had made no changes.
Phillipsburg shot a breath-taking forward from
her thirty-seven yards to Parkinson’s thirty-five,
but, although it deserved to succeed, Bob Peters
had his man guarded too closely and the pass
grounded. A second attempt on a third down
went better and Phillipsburg got seven yards,
three more than needed. Then, on her forty-five,
she started an advance that only slowed when she
was under the Brown-and-White’s goal. Two
forward-passes, each short but certain, took her
well past midfield. After that two tricky split-plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
let her clever quarter through for scandalous
gains, and, almost before Parkinson realised what
was happening, the ball was on the Brown-and-White’s
twenty-one. There was much shouting
from the stands, much anxiety on the benches as
Phillipsburg stabbed the line once for practically
no gain and then dropped a tackle back to kicking
position.</p>

<p>“Any fool could make a goal from there,”
growled “Tip” Harris, who, deposed from left
tackle position, had seated himself beside Dick.
“It’s dead in front of goal and not thirty
yards!”</p>

<p>“But do they mean to try?” asked Dick.
“Seems to me one of those short forwards of
theirs——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I guess they want the three points,
Bates. There’s a lot in getting first blood. Say,
he doesn’t act as if he meant to kick, though! By
jiminy——” Tip raised his voice imploringly:
“Watch a run, Parkinson! Watch that man,
Bob!”</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll, nearby, turned disapprovingly.
“Cut that, Harris,” he ordered. Tip subsided,
muttering. From the teams came many warnings:
“Hold that line, Phillipsburg! Hold that line!”
“Break it up! Block this kick, Parkinson!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
“Watch that half!” “Signals! Signals!”
“Come on! Here we go!”</p>

<p>Back shot the ball to the tall tackle’s waiting
hands. The lines plunged and heaved. The tackle
swung a long leg under him. But the ball hadn’t
left his hands, and now, pushing it into the crook
of his left elbow, he sprang off to the left, the
other backs closing in about him. As quickly as he
had started, he stopped, swung directly about and,
with two Parkinson men trying to reach him past
his interference, raised the pigskin on high and
threw far and swiftly. Thirty yards away a
Phillipsburg end was streaking toward the corner
of the field. Now he was past the line, well into
the end zone, and not an opponent was near him.
Straight for his upstretched hands flew the ball,
like a brown streak, and not until too late did
Parkinson see her danger. Then half a dozen
of her defenders sprang toward the lone enemy.
But the deed was done. Into his hands settled the
ball, he turned on his heel and plunged toward the
goal and when he had been rescued from under
three brown-and-white legged opponents the pigskin
was half-way between side-line and nearer
goal-post.</p>

<p>Phillipsburg waved and cheered, and stood on
the seats and howled, while from across the gridiron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
came a fainter but defiant “Parkinson!
<em>Parkinson!</em> PARKINSON!” Mr. Driscoll
turned his countenance to the bench and shook
his head, smiling ruefully. “Half our team
asleep, fellows,” he said. “Scoville, go in for Furniss!
Warm up, Gaines!”</p>

<p>Phillipsburg missed a fairly easy goal after
the touchdown and play began again in midfield.
There was no more scoring in the quarter although
Gaines, restored to his place at half, twice almost
got clear. Under Cardin’s direction, Parkinson
thrice tried forward-passes and but once succeeded.
Then Gaines, catching, reeled off a dozen
yards before he was forced out of bounds. The
half ended with the score still 6-0.</p>

<p>There was some hard, plain talk in the gymnasium
for the Parkinson audience. Mr. Driscoll was
far from pleased and he didn’t hesitate to make
the fact known. “You fellows have been taught
football for two years, some of you longer, and
yet you went out there and just stood around all
during the first period. That sort of thing won’t
win games! Do something! Try something! If
you can’t do anything else, worry your opponent.
All you did was to hand him the ball back. Stone,
a lot of that was up to you. You had your instructions
to try out your overhead game, and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
running game, and what did you do? You went
at the line every time you got the ball! Now I’m
going to start in with the beginning of this last half
and use the bench. If you don’t want to get licked,
use your heads and play football! You can score
if you try hard enough. You ought to score at
least twice. And if you let those fellows get close
enough to your goal to pull another of those forwards
over the line you deserve to lose! You
were all asleep, every man Jack of you! Long,
where were you when that happened? And you,
Gross? And you, Stone? Someone’s got to watch
the end of the line, fellows! You can’t all go off
visiting like that! You’ve each got a duty to perform
on every play and you each know it, but just
because the other fellow pulls something you
haven’t met up with since last year you forget
everything and go straggling after him to see what
he’ll do! You stay in position after this, no matter
what the other fellow does. Another thing—and
I’m aiming this at you, Wendell, more than anyone—watch
your hands. The rules require that no
part of your body shall be ahead of the line of
scrimmage. If the umpire was strict he’d have
called you off-side twenty times. Keep your arms
down and your hands back until the ball’s in play.
After that I don’t care how fast you bring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
up. Now, then, we’re going to play fast ball this
half. Pryne, you’re quarter. Keep the team on
the jump every minute. Start your signal the
minute the whistle blows and make your men hustle
to positions so that the play can snap off
quickly. You’ve been loafing for two periods.
Now I want to see some <em>work</em>! I want a score inside
the next twelve minutes. Here’s the line-up.”</p>

<p>That the coach meant to “use the bench” was
very evident. Of the original starters only three
remained, Kirkendall, Upton and Peters. Save
for the former, the backfield was all new: Pryne
at quarter, Skinner and Curtis at half: and in
the line were five second- and third-string players.
That Parkinson could win with that aggregation
was far too much to expect, and there were
plenty who said so on the way back to the field
when half-time was over. Stone was still disgruntled
and very pessimistic, and he and Cardin
grumbled together all during the third period.
Usually they had little to say to each other, but
today their wrongs drew them together.</p>

<p>That third period, in spite of the “crape hangers,”
showed the visiting team to far better advantage.
Although, as it turned out, Parkinson
neither scored or came dangerously near scoring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
she played a hard, earnest game and stopped
every attempt of the opponent to get to her last
line. In the first three minutes of the quarter
Phillipsburg attempted a hopeless place-kick from
the thirty-eight yards, but it landed far short, and
after that her desperate forward-passes were always
spoiled. It is only fair to say that luck
favoured the visitors more than once, however.
With an even break of fortune there might have
been a different story to relate.</p>

<p>Pryne ran the team according to directions as
best he could. He lacked experience, though, and
if the play went faster than before it was due
more to the eagerness of the substitutes than to
Pryne’s efforts. Those substitutes did themselves
proud, even if they weren’t strong enough to score,
and, although many fellows on the bench wished
that Coach Driscoll had cared more about winning
and less about developing substitute material,
it was generally agreed that much credit
was due the “rookies.” Before the quarter was
ended Captain Peters was added to the retired
list and Findley took his place.</p>

<p>The third period ended with Phillipsburg making
several changes, something she had refrained
from doing before, and the ball in Parkinson’s
possession on her twenty-nine yards where Skinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
had been downed after a punt. More changes
were made. Trask went in for Kirkendall and
Dean for Upton, at centre, and four other substitutes
trotted nervously on. One of them was Dick.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE LAST QUARTER</small></h2>


<p>Phillipsburg began that final period with all the
confidence born of having held her enemy scoreless
through thirty-six minutes of play. She had
replaced many of her first-string men, but her captain
was still in and so was the quarter-back who
had started. On the Parkinson stand the audience
was on its feet, imploring a touchdown.</p>

<p>Dick had been through some trying moments
during his brief football career at Leonardville,
but he had never felt quite so conspicuous, never
so uncertain of himself, as when he trotted out and
joined the group of brown-jerseyed players
by the thirty-yard line. His heart was beating
like a sledge-hammer and his palms were moist
and there was a funny prickling sensation in his
legs. Diffidence had seldom troubled him before,
and he felt doubly awkward now for that reason.
But there wasn’t much time for thought of his
feelings, for he had hardly joined his team-mates
when the whistle blew the end of the minute intermission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick looked over his companions in the back-field
and wished that he knew more of them.
Trask, in Kirkendall’s position, was much the
same sort of fellow in appearance as K. But he
was lighter, and a good two years younger, Dick
thought. Curtis was a good man and so was Skinner,
but of the two Curtis’s style of play was better
known to Dick. Gleason had been made acting
captain, and it was the substitute guard who
bent behind centre to whisper into the quarter’s
ear.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get Skinner loose, Bates,” said
Gleason. “He’s the boy if he can get away.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s start something, Parkinson!
Signals!”</p>

<p>When the ball came back from between Dean’s
wide-spread legs, Dick whirled and tossed it to
Skinner, and Skinner, rather heavily built but
quick at starting and hard to stop, went hurtling
into the opposing left guard and, with half the
Parkinson team behind him, smashed his way
through for six yards. Then came every indication
of a forward, with the left end edging out and
showing nervous impatience and Dick dropping
back eight yards behind centre and the half-backs
watching the opposing ends. Back shot the ball to
Dick, he made a pretence of throwing it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
left and turned his back to the line. Around swept
Findley, the right end, and to him went the pigskin
at a short, quick pass. The halfs fell into stride
beside him and Dick sprang away to guard the
rear. Four strides, six, and a sharp cry of “In!
In!” The end dug a heel in the trampled sod and
swung to the right. Straight toward the confusion
of swaying bodies that had formed the two lines a
moment before, he raced. Yet there was some
method in the confusion, for Parkinson’s right
end and one half had been drawn across the field
on the false alarm and her tackle had been forced
in. Back of the enemy line the secondary defence
was rushing to the support of the forwards, but
the interference cleaned the hole nicely and Findley
shot through, dodged a tackle and was off at
a tangent, finding holes where there seemed none,
racing diagonally toward the right side-line. The
interference was gone now and he was on his own,
but only the Parkinson quarter remained between
him and the distant goal. Free of the mêlée, he
swung down the field at the forty-yard line, a
scant dozen feet from the boundary.</p>

<p>Behind him came the pursuit, but Findley was
fleet of foot and only the Phillipsburg quarter,
coming fast yet cautiously down on him, caused
him concern. The middle of the field was past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
now and he had gained another yard or two of
elbow-room and the pursuers had not gained.
Then came the supreme instant. The Phillipsburg
quarter sprang with outstretched arms and
Findley gave, turning and twisting, across two
yards of the precious territory at his right. The
quarter’s clutching fingers grasped, held for an
instant, and Findley went staggering to one knee.
Then he was up again, the quarter was rolling
over on his back, legs ludicrously in air, and a
great shriek of triumph came across from the
Parkinson stand. Findley was safe and bearing in
toward the still distant goal, while, behind him,
friend and foe pounded in pursuit.</p>

<p>Dick had followed Findley through the line, had
defeated one eager tackler and had gone sprawling
onto the turf. But he had been on his feet
again an instant later and, skirting the struggling
mass, had kept straight ahead down the field. He
knew that he could not hope to reach Findley in
time to aid him against the quarter-back. His
only chance of helping lay in being well down the
field in case the runner got past the enemy quarter.
None sought to stop him, for the play had
followed the ball, and, while in the ruck of the
pursuit friend and enemy went down and were
strewn behind, Dick had had the centre of the gridiron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to himself, with Findley speeding along well
ahead and to the right and the quarter-back cutting
across to him. Then had come the runner’s
clever escape and now he and Dick were converging
on the goal, the latter gaining a little as the
white lines went slowly underfoot. Never was the
foremost pursuer very far behind, but always,
barring an accident, Findley seemed to have sufficient
margin to win by. Yet, as the thirty-yard
line was left behind, one Phillipsburg player became
momentarily more dangerous. He had managed
to avoid the Parkinson interferers and had
worked himself well into the lead. He was tall
and slight and a runner of no mean ability, and
Dick, turning his head for a quick glance, read the
menace. Findley was tiring slightly and running
more slowly, head back, as Dick, edging further
to the right, brought himself nearer to the path of
the pursuit.</p>

<p>Followed an anxious moment. Findley crossed
the fifteen yards with Dick a scant six feet behind
and the Phillipsburg man gaining on the runner
at every stride. But to reach Findley the
enemy would have to slip around Dick or topple
him aside, and Dick knew it. The rest of the pursuers,
strung back half the length of the field,
were no longer to be reckoned with. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
thumping of swift feet at Dick’s side and he looked
around into the set, intent face of the Phillipsburg
player. The latter meant to swing past Dick and
then, with a final burst of speed, bring Findley
to earth before the goal-line was reached. But
Dick had other views. Slowing imperceptibly, he
let the enemy run even, as he did so catching a
questioning look from a pair of wide, straining
eyes. Then he swung quickly to the right, shoulders
hunched, and went sprawling over and over
on the ground. And with him went the enemy.
And staggering, almost falling, Findley, the pigskin
clutched tightly now to his stomach, crossed
the last white line and sank gratefully to the
turf.</p>

<p>Somewhere, a great distance away as it seemed
to him, there was a subdued roar that sounded
like “<em>Findley! Findley! Findley!</em>”</p>

<p>Minutes later a nervous, anxious youth by name
of Trask directed the pointing of a ball in the
none too steady fingers of Dick, the latter lying
on hip and elbow close to the twenty-yard line.
So much depended on that goal that Trask had at
first mutinously refused to attempt it and had only
consented when convinced that no one else on the
team dared even try. Trask was very deliberate
and many times Dick’s hands moved this way or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that in obedience. Behind Trask the referee knelt
on one knee with upraised hand. Then, when Dick
thought that in just one more second he would
have to yell, there came a firm, quiet “Down!”
from Trask, the referee’s hand dropped swiftly
earthward, a brown object swung past Dick’s eyes
and the ball was gone. Still poised on hip and
elbow, Dick’s eyes followed the revolving oval.
Very slowly it mounted upward, seemed to wobble
uncertainly against the blue sky, veered erratically
to the right as though making straight for
a post and then began to fall. Dick’s heart sank
like a leaden weight. Trask had kicked too short!
Then the ball suddenly went upward again as
though struck from beneath and a din of cheers
and shouts broke the long minutes of silence.</p>

<p>“Struck the bar and went over!” someone
shouted and Dick’s heart leaped upward again as
swiftly as the ball had bounded from the cross-bar.
The Phillipsburg players ended their leaping
charge and with downcast faces walked past as
Dick jumped to his feet. Someone thumped him
tremendously on the back and almost sent him
sprawling to earth again, and Trask’s voice
howled hoarsely: “Got to hold ’em now, Bates!
Got to hold ’em, old man! It’s our game if we
can hold ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re going to!” answered Dick with a
world of confidence in his voice. “We’re going
to hold ’em, Trask! It’s our day! Come
on!”</p>

<p>And hold them they did, although there were
moments during the remaining nine or ten minutes
when things looked dark indeed for the visitors.
Phillipsburg hustled in new players and went back
at the enemy tooth and nail. A bewildering variety
of single and double and even triple passes
were essayed. Some succeeded, most failed, but
all were puzzling and unnerving to a team of
third- and even fourth-string players, and that
Parkinson managed to stave off defeat in that final
quarter was scarcely less than a miracle. End
runs got away and yet were stopped short of disaster,
and always Dick clung to the ball to the
last desperate moment before yielding it by a
punt. Parkinson didn’t make the mistake of playing
only for safety, for a purely defensive game
kept up for a length of time takes the heart out
of the defenders. When Parkinson got the ball
she attacked as hard as ever, and some of the substitutes
won real laurels that afternoon. But at
last the end came, after Phillipsburg had thrice
won her way inside her opponent’s thirty yards
and had once got to her fourteen, and eleven joyous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
tired, breathless youths fell against each other
and babbled incoherent congratulations.</p>

<p>An hour later players and rooters mingled happily
on the home-bound train and in a corner of
one car Dick and Stanley and Blash and Rusty
crowded themselves in and over and around one
seat designed for two persons and made merry.
Dick’s merriment was less strenuous than that of
the others, for that brief session had left him
rather limp and tired. It had also, it appeared,
left him somewhat of a hero to his friends, for
Blash declared that only Dick’s interference had
won the game.</p>

<p>“Findley’s run was a corker,” said Blash, “and
he ought to have the Victoria Cross for it, but it
wouldn’t have scored if you hadn’t been Johnny-on-the-Spot,
Dick. Why, Lovering would have
had Findley as sure as shooting! Of course, we
might have smashed it over from the ten yards,
and then again we might not have. I think we
might not have. What saved the bacon for us was
you bowling Lovering over, and don’t you forget
it! The Victoria Cross for Findley and the Distinguished
Service Cross for you. I’ll order them
at once.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman is quite correct,” said Rusty,
“although it isn’t a usual condition with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
And, look here, fellows, while we’re pinning bouquets
on, why not say a couple of kind words for
the whole bloomin’ team that held those Phillipsburg
guys innocuous—I believe that’s the word,
Stan?—innocuous all through the last dreadful
quarter? I ask you why not, and again I ask
you——”</p>

<p>“Moved and carried,” droned Blash, “that the
hearty thanks of the meeting be extended to the
team. So ordered. There being no other business
before the meeting, a motion to adjourn
will——”</p>

<p>“Move you, Mr. Chairman, that Stan be appointed
a committee of one to find the train-boy
and buy much sweet chocolate. All in favour——”</p>

<p>“What with?” demanded Stanley sarcastically.
“Seven cents? You borrowed every red
I’d borrowed from Dick, Rusty. What did you
do with it?”</p>

<p>Rusty grinned, gulped and broke into chuckles.
“I spent it, dear one,” he giggled. “And ’twas
well-spent, believe thouest me! Listen and I’ll
tell you—Hold on, though! Who buys the chocolate?
Honest, I’m far too faint to narrate this
moving tale. Have a heart, Blash!”</p>

<p>“I’m busted, son. Honest!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick produced a few silver coins and some pennies.
“I’ll be the goat,” he said, “but someone
else must do the buying. I wouldn’t stir from
here for a thousand dollars; even if I could, which
I can’t with Stan sitting on my shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Give me the pelf,” volunteered Stanley, with
a sigh. “Which way do I go?”</p>

<p>“Forward,” advised Rusty. “I saw him going
through ten minutes ago. Better hurry, too, for
he didn’t appear to be overstocked.”</p>

<p>Stanley went wearily away along the crowded
aisle and Blash reminded Rusty of the tale. “Go
on,” he said, “and let’s hear your criminal adventures.”</p>

<p>“Wait till Stan comes back. Don’t I tell you
I’m faint from want of food? Besides, Stan’s going
to enjoy this yarn. Jumping Jehosophat, I
wish we were home and I was eating my supper!
Isn’t anyone else starved?”</p>

<p>“We all are,” said Blash, “only we don’t—don’t
wear our stomachs on our sleeves!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed and Rusty shook his head wonderingly.
“The kid is clever,” he murmured.
“Ah, here he comes! Empty-handed, by jiminy!
No, he bears succor! A-a-y, Gard! Sweet youth,
I bid you welcome! Where’s mine? <em>Wha-a-at?</em>
Only three cakes for all that money I supplied you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with? What do you know—Oh, well, I’ll try to
worry along on this. Folks, that tastes good!
Now then, lend me your ears and everything and
I’ll narrate to you the story of The Careful
Spender and the Helpful Friend.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>RUSTY BRINGS A FRIEND</small></h2>


<p>“When I left you in the restarong,” began
Rusty, “I hied me forth in pursuit of a youth
whose countenance I had spied through the window,
in short, none other than Sandy Halden.
Sandy said he was looking for someone, I forget
who, and I said I’d help him look. I believe in
helping others whenever it isn’t too hard work.”</p>

<p>“Why that pill, though?” asked Stanley.
“Thought you had no use for Sandy.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite wrong then,” answered Rusty
earnestly. “To the eager and inquiring mind
nothing is useless. Anyhow, you shut up and let
me tell this. Sandy and I wandered through the
metropolis side by each, admiring the soaring edifices
and the homes of ease and luxury. And as
we strolled, we talked. Maybe I talked more than
Sandy did, but that’s neither here nor there.
Among other things I said was this: ‘They’re
charging fifty cents to see the game this afternoon,
Sandy, and that’s too much. Not that I’m
going to pay it, though. I’m going to see it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
nothing.’ Of course that interested Sandy tremenjously,
for Sandy doesn’t mind spending
money any more than a Scotsman! He wanted to
know how I was going to do it; did I have a pass
or what. ‘Don’t have to have a pass,’ I told
him. ‘Maybe you’ve noticed that one of the dormitories
is right close to the field? Well, if you
happen to have a friend there whose room is on
the back, you don’t have to spend your good
money. You just sit in the window up there
quite comfortably and look right down on the field.
Of course, you’re not as close as you are in a
stand, but you can see everything that goes on
and you’re saving a big old half-dollar. And a
half-dollar is a lot of money about the middle of
the month!’ Sandy agreed cordially to that sentiment
and said he wished that he knew someone in
one of those dormitories. I said, yes, it would
be nice if he did, and looked at my watch, remarking
that I mustn’t be late for my engagement.
Then we happened on a candy store and I stopped
and looked in the window and said something
about the caramels looking nice. I could see
Sandy struggling mentally and I kept on looking
at the caramels. He tried to edge off, but I
wouldn’t edge. So finally he said in a weak little
voice that he guessed he’d get a few and we went in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and he bought a quarter of a pound for fifteen
cents. Then we strolled on and ate the caramels,
and after a bit I said sort of thoughtfully: ‘Look
here, Sandy, if you’d like to see the game with me
I guess it would be all right. My friend is a
mighty nice sort and I don’t think he’d mind if I
brought you along.’”</p>

<p>“What friend?” asked Dick, puzzled.</p>

<p>“My friend in Wallack Hall,” replied Rusty,
with a grin. “Wallack’s the dormitory that looks
like a tomb and has ivy all over it.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dick uncertainly. Blash made a derisive
noise in his throat and Stanley chuckled.</p>

<p>“Well, Sandy was that pleased! Gee, fellows,
it does give one a fine feeling to give pleasure to
others, doesn’t it? Sandy was quite affecting.
He said I was mighty kind and he wouldn’t forget
it and he’d like awfully to meet my friend. So we
came to a drug store about then and I said I was
thirsty and Sandy insisted on buying sodas. By
that time it was getting on toward two and I
asked a fellow in the store how to get out to the
school and he told me and we started out. I had
to pay the car fares, for Sandy was looking out
the window hard when the conductor came around.
When we got out there I said we’d better walk
around awhile and see the place, and we so did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and when it was about time for the game to start
I conducted Sandy to Wallack. ‘He may not be
in yet,’ I said, ‘because he has a two o’clock recitation,
but he said I was to make myself at home
until he got back.’ So we climbed two flights of
stairs and I went along looking at the numbers
on the doors, telling Sandy I didn’t quite remember
which room it was. Sandy kept asking me
what the fellow’s name was and reading the cards,
but I put him off until I found the room. Then
I knocked, and, sure enough, Harold wasn’t in, but
he’d left the door open and so we went on in. It
was a bully room, with a lot of corking furniture
and pictures and so on, and we looked around and
waited for Harold to come back. You couldn’t see
as much of the field as I’d expected, because the
top of the grand stand cut off the nearer side of
it, but it wasn’t bad, and I made Sandy take his
coat off and sit down on the window-seat. He
was very grateful, was Sandy. Doing things for
him is a real pleasure, fellows!” And Rusty
looked around the small circle of his audience with
much feeling. Stanley was chuckling and Blash
and Dick grinning broadly, and Rusty seemed surprised
at their amusement.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s about all there is to tell, except
that presently Sandy called out that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
starting the game and I came over and looked out
over his shoulder and saw that he was telling the
truth. ‘Funny Harold doesn’t show up,’ I said,
as concerned as anything. So I opened the door
and looked up and down the corridor and there
wasn’t anyone in sight and the building was
awfully silent. ‘Guess I’ll go down to the entrance,
Sandy,’ I said, ‘and see if I can see him.
You sit tight.’ So Sandy said all right, he would,
and that Phillipsburg had just kicked-off, and I
went out and closed the door gently but firmly behind
me, absent-mindedly turning the key in the
lock, and went downstairs. Harold wasn’t in
sight and so I went on around to the field.”</p>

<p>“You locked Sandy in there?” exclaimed Stanley
incredulously and joyfully. Rusty grinned
and nodded.</p>

<p>“I guess so. I didn’t try the door, but the key
turned all right.”</p>

<p>The others were fairly howling. “Wouldn’t I
like to have been there when the owner of the
room got back!” gasped Blash. “<em>What</em> do you
suppose Sandy told him?”</p>

<p>“He told him the truth,” laughed Rusty, “but
I don’t believe Summer believed him.”</p>

<p>“Summer? Not that big left-guard of theirs?”
cried Stanley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Harold Summer.”</p>

<p>“Then—then you <em>do</em> know him?”</p>

<p>“Only by reputation,” replied Rusty modestly.
“I’ve never had the honour of meeting him.”</p>

<p>“How’d you know where he roomed?”</p>

<p>“Easy. Looked up the fellows on the team until
I found a couple who roomed in Wallack. Half
of them do room there, because it’s a sort of
senior dormitory, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Looked ’em up where?” demanded Dick.</p>

<p>“In the school catalogue. There was a copy in
the library. I forgot to say that we visited the
library amongst other places of interest. I found
one football chap lived in 17 Wallack and another
in 28, and I knew that one of them must be on
the back, and it turned out to be 17, and that was
Harold’s dive.”</p>

<p>“Summer’s? But, look here, seems to me Summer’s
name is George,” said Stanley. “Where
do you get this ‘Harold’ stuff?”</p>

<p>“Had to call him something, and Harold
sounded sort of convincing, sort of like what a
Phillipsburg fellow <em>would</em> be called. Get me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, say, suppose Summer didn’t go
back to his room until after supper or something?
Have you seen Sandy since?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s aboard. I saw him in the station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
He didn’t see me, though. I think he wants to.
That’s one reason I wasn’t keen for going after
the chocolate. Something tells me that Sandy has
misconstrued my innocent efforts to save his
money for him!”</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’ll bet he’s mad enough to bite a
nail!” chuckled Stanley. “Of all the crazy stunts,
Rusty, that’s the craziest! How did you know
Summer wouldn’t have a room-mate and that the
room-mate wouldn’t be in when you got there?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. I couldn’t find that out without going
through the whole catalogue, and there wasn’t
time for that. If there’d been anyone in when I
knocked I’d have just asked for a fictitious name
and backed out again. Anyway, I don’t see what
Sandy has to be peeved about. He saw the game
without paying a cent!”</p>

<p>“Except for the caramels and soda,” laughed
Blash. “I wish I could have been behind a door
or some place when Summer walked in and found
Sandy sitting there!”</p>

<p>“Maybe Sandy got wise and got away before
Summer came back,” suggested Stanley anxiously.
But Rusty shook his head. “He probably got wise,
all right, but I’ll bet he didn’t get out! There
was only one door and that was locked. There
wasn’t any transom and the window was two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
stories up. And I don’t believe there was a soul
in the building; every fellow was at the game.”</p>

<p>“How the dickens did you ever think of the
scheme?” asked Stanley admiringly. Rusty
shrugged modestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it just sort of came to me. Like an inspiration,
you know. Well, that settles one or
two old scores between Sandy and me, I guess.
I hope Summer didn’t beat him up, but still, if
he did—” Rusty shrugged again. “I should
grow faint and be carried out!”</p>

<p>“Rusty, you’re a wonder!” said Blash earnestly.
“You’ll be hung if you live long enough;
there’s no doubt about that: but in the meanwhile
you certainly do add to the joy of nations!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, hung?” demanded Rusty
indignantly. “My record is as clean and my life
as stainless—Oh, my sainted grandmother! Here
he comes! Hide me behind your stalwart frame,
Blash!”</p>

<p>From the farther end of the swaying coach
came Sandy Halden, gloom and wrath upon his
brow, his gaze seeking his enemy. A few seats
away his eyes fell on Rusty and they blazed in
triumph. He shoved his way past an accumulation
of suit-cases and faced his benefactor, his
shock-hair standing up defiantly under the cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he wore and his long nose twitching like a rabbit’s.
Rusty viewed him calmly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sandy,” he greeted. “Great game,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“A great game you put up on me!” sputtered
Sandy. “I suppose you think you’re mighty
smart, eh? You wait till I’m through with you,
Crozier! I’ll make you wish you weren’t so
blamed funny! I’ll show you what a real joke
is! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Rusty, soothingly.
“What’s your kick, Sandy? You saw the game
all right, didn’t you? And you saved a whole
half-dollar, didn’t you? What more do you want?
By the way, I suppose you introduced yourself
to Harold? Sorry I couldn’t stick around!”</p>

<p>“He was all right, don’t you worry! I told
him about you and he said a few things you ought
to have heard! His name isn’t Harold——”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t mean that we got into the
wrong room!” exclaimed Rusty incredulously.
“Wasn’t it Harold Jones’ room, Sandy?”</p>

<p>“You know mighty well whose room it was!”
answered the other indignantly. “That’s all
right! I’ll get even with you! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>am</em> sorry!” declared Rusty miserably.
“Such an awkward mistake to make. I don’t see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
how I could have been so stupid! Whatever can
I do to show my contrition, Sandy?”</p>

<p>By this time most of the fellows within hearing
were listening eagerly and amusedly, and it
dawned on Sandy that he was making a mistake
to advertise the joke. “Never mind your contrition,”
he growled in a lower voice, “I’ll fix you,
Crozier. Don’t think you can get away with it.”
His eyes swept the grinning or amused faces of
Rusty’s companions. “You make me sick, anyway,
the whole lot of you!” he added. “If I
tell Jud what you did, Crozier, you won’t think
it’s so funny!” With which veiled threat he
swung angrily away and the car door crashed resoundingly
behind him.</p>

<p>Blash and Stanley were somewhat sobered, but
Rusty still beamed. “I wonder what Summer did
say!” he chuckled. “I wish I knew!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Stanley, “you don’t suppose
he will go to Jud, do you? You know, Rusty,
Jud’s a bit down on you!”</p>

<p>“He won’t. He knows that if he did I’d beat
him to a stiff froth! Anyhow, what of it? Jud
will only appreciate my kindness of heart. It
wasn’t really my fault if we stumbled into the
wrong room.”</p>

<p>“That won’t go with Jud,” said Blash, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his head. “Still, I don’t believe Sandy will
blab. What say, Gus? Oh, he was sort of peeved
over something that happened.” Blash turned to
Gus Stone, who was leaning over the back of the
seat. “You know how Sandy is. Thinks fellows
are trying to put something over on him.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” persisted Stone, smiling
broadly in anticipation.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing much, really. It was all—a mistake.”
Blash looked as innocent as a new-born
babe. “You see, Rusty offered to introduce
Sandy to a friend of his at Phillipsburg whose
room overlooked the football field so that Sandy
wouldn’t have to pay to see the game, and by
accident they got into the wrong room and Rusty
went out to look for his friend and thoughtlessly
locked the door behind him. Of course, when
the fellow who lived there got back and found
Sandy, he was surprised! And Sandy has got
it into his head that Rusty put up a job on him.
Which just shows, Gus, that even with the best
intentions in the world you sometimes go wrong!”</p>

<p>“Warne! Warne!” called a trainman. “Change
for Sturgis, Bradfield, Seppit’s Mill and points
on the Westfield Branch! Wa-a-arne!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>CAPTAIN PETERS ENTERTAINS</small></h2>


<p>Dick received his meed of praise for his part in
securing Parkinson’s victory over Phillipsburg,
but naturally the greater credit went to Findley,
as it should have. Dick found, however, on the
following Monday that he had become of a little
more importance on the gridiron. Billy Goode
was most solicitous as to his condition and Coach
Driscoll was a little bit “fussy” over him. He
saw plenty of hard work, however, for Gus Stone
and Cardin, together with several others, were
excused from practice that afternoon. Dick and
Pryne were kept busy and when the Second Team
came over for a scrimmage it was Dick to whom
fell the honour of generaling the First. The
team made hard sledding that day, and the Second
put over a touchdown and a safety in the
first half and made her opponent hustle in the
second half to win. The substitutes acted stale
and were slower than cold molasses, to use
Gaines’ metaphor, and even Dick, who had certainly
not been overworked on Saturday, found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hard to put snap into his play. Perhaps the
weather had something to do with it, for the day
was mild and misty and even the ball felt heavy.</p>

<p>After practice Dick went back to the gymnasium
with lagging feet, paying little heed to the
talk of the fellows about him. Somehow, nothing
was vastly interesting today, and the thought
of supper held no attraction. A cold shower
braced him somewhat, however, and as it was
still short of five o’clock—for practice had been
slightly shorter than usual—he turned his steps
back to the field where the Track Team candidates
were still at work. The high hurdles were
being set and Stanley and five other boys were
waiting at the head of the straight-way. Dick
spoke to several of the group and seated himself
on a stone roller beside the cinders. Billy Goode
was in charge and Billy called to Dick remonstratingly.</p>

<p>“Bates, you oughtn’t to be sitting around here
like that,” he said. “Put a sweater over your
shoulders. Take one of those on the bench there.”</p>

<p>“I’m as warm as toast, Billy,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“You do as I tell you,” said Billy in a very
ferocious voice. And so Dick got up and crossed
the track and picked up a sweater from among
the half-dozen tossed on the bench. Stanley, overhearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the colloquy, left his place near the starting
line and joined Dick on the roller. “Hello,
what are you doing here, Dick?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just came over to see you fellows at your
play.”</p>

<p>“Play, eh? Son, this isn’t play, this is har-r-rd
work. I’ve done four sprints and I’ve got a kink
in my calf—” he rubbed his left leg ruefully—“and
now Billy says we’ve got to do time-trials.
How did football go?”</p>

<p>“Rotten, I guess. The Second scored nine on
us.”</p>

<p>“What? For the love of Pete! What did you
do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we got eleven, finally. But everyone was
dopey today and Driscoll was peevish and nobody
loved us. Who’s the elongated chap with
the pipe-stem legs, Stan?”</p>

<p>“Arends. He’s a corking hurdler, though the
low’s his best game. The little chap, Mason, is
good, too. Doesn’t look like a hurdler, does he?
Well, here’s where I suffer. Wait around and
I’ll go back with you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Dick, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe! How do you get that way? You
talk like an expiring clam! I’ll be back here in
a minute, you chump.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. Go to it, Stan. Beat ’em, son!”</p>

<p>“Beat ’em nothing! I tell you I’ve got a kink
in my left leg that’s no joke. But I’ll do my bestest
for you, Dickie.”</p>

<p>Stanley pranced back to the start and Dick
watched while the first three, Stanley, Arends and
another, got on the mark and awaited the pistol.
There was one false start and then they were
off, three lithe, white-clad bodies, speeding down
the straight-way over the cinders. Arends reached
his first barrier a half stride ahead of his team-mates,
skimmed above it with never an inch to
spare, and took his stride again. Then the other
two flashed up and down in unison, and after
that from Dick’s post of observation it was anyone’s
race. Arends upset his fourth hurdle, and
the third boy, whose name Dick didn’t know, had
trouble with them all without knocking any down,
and ultimately finished a good five yards behind
the winners, for Stanley and Arends ran a dead-heat.
While the other three hurdlers were preparing
for their turn and Dick awaited Stanley,
Sandy Halden arrived at the bench across the
track and fumbled at the sweaters there. Dick
noted the fact without interest. After a moment
Sandy moved across to where Dick sat, and:</p>

<p>“That your sweater you’ve got?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did you say?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I said, is that your sweater you’re wearing?”</p>

<p>“My sweater? Oh, this! No, I found it over
there on the bench. Is it yours?” He untied
the sleeves from around his neck and held it out.</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” answered Sandy indignantly
as he snatched it away. “And I’ll thank you to
leave my things alone, Bates!”</p>

<p>Now Dick happened to be in a poor sort of
mood just then, and Sandy’s unreasonable displeasure
accorded illy with it.</p>

<p>“If I’d known it was yours I wouldn’t have
touched it with a ten-foot pole,” he replied angrily,
“much less worn it!”</p>

<p>“Well, you did touch it, and you’d no business
to. Wear your own things after this and
let mine alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for-<em>get</em> it!” cried Dick, jumping up impatiently.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sandy misunderstood that move, for,
dropping the sweater to the sod, he stepped forward
and sent a blow straight at Dick’s face. The
latter, seeing it coming, ducked at the last instant
and then, as Sandy followed the delivery, brought
him up short with a blow on the chin. After that
there was a merry scrap while it lasted, which
wasn’t long, for Billy Goode, who had an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
before sent the hurdlers away, and several of the
fellows about the starting line, dashed in between.</p>

<p>“Here! Here!” cried the trainer. “What do
you boys think you’re doing? Behave now, the
both of you! Suppose someone had seen you!
Right here on the field! Are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“He started it,” panted Sandy.</p>

<p>“Never mind who started it,” replied Billy
severely. “I’m stopping it. You beat it in, Halden.
You’ve no business loafing around here anyway.
Didn’t Jimmy tell you to go to the showers?
You’d be better off somewhere else, too,
Bates, and not coming around here starting ructions!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t start any,” growled Dick. “He tried
to slam me one and I gave it back to him.” Then,
wiping his knuckles on his trousers, to the detriment
of that garment, he managed a grin. “I’m
sorry, Billy,” he said. “Maybe it was my fault,
although I didn’t hit first.”</p>

<p>“Well,” grumbled the trainer, mollified a trifle,
“don’t take chances like that again. It’s my
duty to report the both of you, but maybe I’ll
forget it if I don’t see you around.”</p>

<p>Sandy Halden had already gone off and now
Stanley arrived, his eyes round with curiosity,
and hauled Dick away in his wake. “What the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dickens was the matter?” he demanded. “First
thing I saw was you and Stanley dancing around
like a couple of trained bears. I thought it was
fun until I saw you land one. What did he do?”</p>

<p>Dick thought a moment. “Nothing, I guess.
Nothing much, anyway. He found me wearing
his sweater over my shoulders and told me to
leave his things alone, and I lost my temper and
got up to go away, and I guess he thought I was
going at him and tried to land on my nose.”</p>

<p>“Hm, looks as if he’d landed on your cheek,”
said Stanley. “Hope you didn’t let him get away
with that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, not from the way my hand
aches,” responded Dick grimly. “I suppose if
Billy told faculty I’d get the dickens, eh?”</p>

<p>“You would, my misguided friend. You’d get
about a month’s probation. But Billy won’t tell.
He’s never told anything yet, and he’s had lots
of chances. If you have to scrap here, Dick, go
over to the brickyard. That’s where all the best
things are pulled off. It’s funny about that, too,”
continued Stanley musingly. “Faculty usually
knows what’s going on, but in my time there have
been at least two dozen fights in the brickyard
and nothing’s ever been said or done about them.
Looks as if Jud sort of winked at it, doesn’t it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Maybe he has a hunch that a square fight is the
best medicine sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Sandy wants to go on with it I’ll meet
him there.”</p>

<p>“Sandy? Oh, he won’t, I guess. He likes to
scrap sometimes, but he’s most all bluster. Guess
he’s the sort that has to get good and mad before
he can get his courage up. I’ll doctor that face
of yours before we go to supper so Cooper or
Wolan won’t ask embarrassing questions. Cooper’s
a hound for scenting scraps. Not that
he’d do anything, though, except look wise
and say, ‘Hm, you don’t tell me, Bates? Most
int’sting!’”</p>

<p>Dick laughed at Stanley’s mimicry of the
instructor’s pronunciation. “I like Cooper,
though,” he said. “And I don’t like Wolan.”</p>

<p>“Nobody does—except Wolan! By the way, I
told Bob Peters I’d come around tonight and
bring you along. He’s giving a soiree.”</p>

<p>“A—a what?” asked Dick as they entered the
dormitory.</p>

<p>“A soiree,” laughed Stanley. “That means
eats, son. Bob’s soirees are famous. He’s got
an uncle or something in the hotel business in
Springfield—or maybe it’s Hartford: somewhere,
anyhow—who sends him a box of chow about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
every two or three months. Then Bob invites
a crowd in and there’s a feast.”</p>

<p>“Sure he asked me along?”</p>

<p>“Absotively! He was quite particular about
you. ‘Be sure and fetch Bates,’ he said. So,
if you know your business, you’ll go light on supper.”</p>

<p>“I shall anyway,” replied Dick. “I’m not hungry—much.
Say, if you show any chance of making
the team in earnest, Stan, they take you on
one of the training tables, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, but that needn’t worry you.
Some fellows don’t get on until the season’s half
over.”</p>

<p>“It’s half over now,” said Dick thoughtfully.
“There are only four more games.”</p>

<p>“Is that right? Well, I wouldn’t be surprised
if we lost your charming society very soon, Dick.
Now let’s have a look at the—er—abrasions. Say,
he certainly handed you something, didn’t he?
Good it didn’t land a couple of inches further
to the left. If it had it would have closed one
of your cute little peepers. Wait till I get some
water and stuff. Did you see a bottle of witch-hazel—I’ve
got it! I’ll be back in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Dick critically observed his countenance during
Stanley’s trip to the lavatory. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a fine big lump over the right cheek-bone that
made him look curiously lop-sided. He heartily
wished he had kept his temper. The swelling
would be there until morning at least and it
wouldn’t require a giant intellect to guess the
reason for it. Of course, he could say he had
done it in football, only if he had got the contusion
in that way Billy Goode or one of the assistants
would have had it dressed with arnica long
ago. Stanley came back with a mug of water
and administered quite professionally, and a few
minutes later Dick went across to supper redolent
of witch hazel and very puffy as to his right cheek.
Facetious remarks were many and Dick’s unsmiling
explanation that he had “got it on the field”
didn’t appear to deceive any of his table companions.
The subsequent sight of Sandy Halden
with a roseate blush around his right eye somewhat
consoled Dick. By morning the rosy tinge
would have changed to green and yellow, shading
to purple.</p>

<p>There were eight fellows in Bob Peters’ room
in Leonard Hall when Dick and Stanley arrived,
and the eight didn’t include the host himself, for,
as Sid Crocker explained, Bob had gone to the
village to get some lemons. Dick met three or
four fellows not previously known to him, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
them the spindle-shanked Arends he had noticed
on the track earlier. At intervals other fellows
arrived and, before Bob Peters returned, the two
rooms, for Bob shared a study and bedroom with
“Babe” Upton, were filled almost to capacity.
Leonard was the newest of the Parkinson dormitories
and, in comparison with such as Williams
and Goss, was most luxurious. There was a real,
“sure-enough” fireplace in the big study and in
it this evening a cannel-coal fire was burning in
spite of the fact that the windows were open. A
folding card-table was set against the wall and
a blue-and-white checked cloth hid enticing mysteries.
Jerry Wendell aroused laughter by edging
up to the table and with elaborate carelessness
lifting a corner of the cloth. What he saw,
however, he refused to divulge. Presently, into
a babel of talk and laughter, hurried Bob with
a bag of lemons.</p>

<p>“Hello, everybody!” he shouted. “Glad to see
you. Babe, stick these on the bed in there. I
bought a knife, too. Catch! How many lemons
does one need for a dozen cans of sardines, Sid?
I got two dozen. That ought to do, what?”</p>

<p>“I’d say so,” laughed Sid. “What’s your idea?
Serve a sardine on every lemon? A half-dozen
would have been enough, you chump.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would? Well, I asked the Greek at the fruit
store and he said two dozen. I thought maybe he
was deceiving me. Hello, Fat!”</p>

<p>Arends smiled genially at the ironic appellation
and hunched his elongated person into a smaller
compass on the window-seat to make room for
new arrivals. Most of the fellows there were
football players, and all, it seemed, were connected
with some sport. Sid, beside whom Dick
found a seat on a leather couch, pointed out several
celebrities: Colgan, the hockey star; Cheever,
Parkinson’s crack two-miler, who also did satisfactory
stunts with the hammer; Lewis, the tall
and keen-eyed first baseman, and one or two more.
Everyone’s mood appeared to be peculiarly happy,
even flippant, and if football or baseball or any
other form of “shop” was mentioned someone
immediately howled the speaker down. Two or
three of the guests had brought musical instruments
and soon there came the sound of tuning
and then someone began to hum under the babel
of talk and someone else joined, and presently
conversation had ceased and everyone was singing.
Between songs the talk went on. Bob demanded
“How We Love Our Faculty” and the
elongated Arends obediently stood up and was
joined by a short, plump and red-cheeked youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with a guitar. Arends was preternaturally solemn
and the plump chap who pressed against him
and looked up into his face as he strummed the
strings had the expression of a melancholy owl.
Everyone ceased talking and waited, smiling
broadly. The plump youth struck a chord and
Arends began in a whining voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There’s old Jud Lane, our Principal,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You know him? We know him!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He is a dear old, grand old pal.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You know him? We know him!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I hope no harm will e’er befall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This dear old, grand old Principal,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And if into the drink he’d fall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We’d pull him out, one and all.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Now would we? Well, would we?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The responses were made in chorus by the rest
of the crowd, and the final “Well, would we?”
had a peculiar suggestion of sarcasm! Then came
the refrain, measured and sonorous:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, how we love our Faculty, our Faculty, our Faculty!<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><a href="#image03">Oh, how we love our Faculty!</a>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_189">“<i>How we love our Faculty!</i>”</a></div>
</div>

<p>(Ensued a silence in which Dick saw every
mouth forming words that were not uttered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
then a final outburst, long-drawn-out, like a solemn
benediction:)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Our Fac-ul-ty!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More verses followed in which various lesser
lights were celebrated, and through it all Arends
preserved his solemn countenance and the accompanist
gazed soulfully up into it. Everyone
seemed to enjoy the song immensely. Dick, by
watching Sid’s lips, discovered that the unuttered
sentiment was “We hope the blame things choke!”</p>

<p>Then “Babe” Upton twanged a banjo and improvised
the verses of a song whose refrain ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Up and down and all around, that’s the way we find ’em!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Two for five and three for ten, and here’s a string to bind ’em!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dick thought Babe’s faculty for making rhymes
quite marvelous until he noticed that he used only
three or four in the course of a dozen verses. Before
he had finished, half of those present had
been sung about. The verses weren’t remarkable
for sense of rhythm, but they always won laughter
and applause. Cheever came in for the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here’s big Jim Cheever, looking fine.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He always does when he’s out to dine.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You couldn’t keep Jim away to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For he’s right there with his appetite!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And even Dick didn’t escape, for Babe turned
his grinning face toward the couch and twanged
the strings and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Jerry Wendell gave imitations, one of Mr. Addicks,
the Greek and Latin instructor, being especially
clever. Wendell leaned over the back of
a chair and drew his face into long lines. “Young
gentlemen,” he began in a slow, precise and kindly
voice, “the trees are budding this beautiful morning
and the little birds are chirping to one another
and there’s a feeling of spring in the air.
You may have noticed it, young gentlemen? As
Juvenal so poetically phrases it, ‘Sic transit gloria
mundi, Veluti in speculum Sunday.’ Are there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
any amongst you this bright morning who know
who Juvenal was? Is there one? No, I feared
as much. Warden, would it inconvenience you
to open your eyes and give me your attention?
Ah, I thank you. Yes, young gentlemen, spring
is upon us. Especially is it upon you. I have
but to gaze on your rapt, intelligent countenances,
your bright and eager faces, to realize how thoroughly
you are imbued with the Spirit of the
Spring. If Townsend will drag his legs out of the
aisle—I thank you. Spring is a wonderful season,
young gentlemen, a beautiful season, the vernal
equinox, as a poet has so well phrased it. The
Greeks, as you doubtless recall, celebrated the
coming of spring with appropriate observances.
And yet it may be that the fact has escaped many
of you. A pity, a great pity! Suppose, therefore,
that you refresh your memories on the subject
and be prepared tomorrow to tell me in what
way the Greeks welcomed the advent of spring.
And we will have tomorrow what the spring has
prevented us from having today, and also the
next two pages. Young gentlemen, the class is
dismissed. Will some one of you kindly awaken
Peters as you pass out?”</p>

<p>Then the host flicked away the cloth from the
table and there was an outburst of applause for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
what lay revealed. Sandwiches of many sorts,
potted delectations, cakes and pastries, biscuits and
cheese and much ginger ale. After that came a
half-hour of earnest endeavour on the part of
each and every one to ruin digestion, with Bob
maintaining a sharp and yet lenient watch on the
football fellows, to whom pastry was taboo. Bob’s
“soiree” ended in a final burst of song that
brought an apologetic warning from a proctor.
Afterwards Dick and Stanley walked across to
Sohmer humming the tune of Babe’s absurd jingle,
Stanley breaking into words as they climbed
the dormitory stairs:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>MR. BATES PROTESTS</small></h2>


<p>That party in Captain Peters’ room has no bearing
on the story save that it seemed to Dick to
mark the beginning of a closer intimacy with the
football crowd. He heard himself alluded to as
Dick Bates, instead of Bates, and from that to
Dick was a matter of only a few days. And there
were other signs, too; as when, during practice
on Wednesday, Kirkendall, relieved by Trask in
the scrimmage, sank into the bench at Dick’s side,
gave his knee a mighty and somewhat painful
thump, grinned and relapsed into silence. Had
“K” spoken Dick wouldn’t have thought so much
of it. The fact that the big full-back considered
words unnecessary meant so much more.</p>

<p>There were some mighty sessions of work that
week, for Coach Driscoll was smoothing out the
First Team attack, adding a new play now and
then, shifting his players experimentally and drilling,
drilling, drilling until Dick sometimes awoke
at night with the cry of “<em>Signals!</em>” in his ears.
He had his full share of quarter-back work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
B Squad and worked as hard and intelligently
as he knew how. Such work was different at
Parkinson than at Leonardville High. At the latter
place playing quarter meant developing individual
ability first and letting team-work look
after itself in a measure. Here at Parkinson
one was ground and filed and fitted into the eleven
much as a machine part is fitted into the assembled
whole, and one was a unit of the team first
and an individual last. At first Dick had been
disappointed over a reality so different from his
secret expectations. Although he had openly professed
humility and had told the fellows at Leonardville
that he might not count for much in a
football way at a school as large as Parkinson,
yet he had never greatly doubted that his advent
would be a matter of importance to the school,
nor that he would find the path to glory broad
and easy. He had outlived the surprise and disappointment,
however, and was ready to defend
the Parkinson system with his last breath, a system
that played no favourites and judged only by
results.</p>

<p>Parkinson played the local high school the following
Saturday. Warne was a hard-fighting but
light team and the game was one-sided from the
start. Dick, rather to his surprise, was trotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
on in the middle of the second quarter, when
Stone was slightly hurt in a flying tackle, and
stayed in until the last period began. He ran
the team well and handled several difficult punts
in a clever manner, but he had no opportunity to
distinguish himself, nor did he seek one. Overanxiety
on one occasion led him into a wretched
fumble under Warne’s goal and once he got his
signals so badly jumbled that Bob Peters had to
come to his rescue. But the fumble led to
no disaster and the mixed signals signified
little.</p>

<p>Parkinson rolled up a total of thirty-three points
in forty-eight minutes of playing time and managed
to keep High School at bay until, in the
final few moments, with a substitute line in, High
School, having worked down to Parkinson’s thirty-four
on a forward-pass, dropped a really remarkable
goal from about the forty yards. To be sure,
there was a strong wind blowing almost straight
with the ball, but even so the kick was as neat
a one as had been seen on Parkinson Field that
season and none begrudged the frantic delight that
the visitors obtained from those three points. In
fact, Parkinson applauded quite as heartily as
did the High School rooters.</p>

<p>On Monday occurred a momentous event in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Dick’s estimation. He was taken to the training
table.</p>

<p>Being taken to the training table perhaps did
not signify so much in itself, for the table was
in reality two tables, each holding from twelve
to fourteen, and one might spend a football season
at one of them without winning his letter in
either of the two games that counted, Chancellor
and Kenwood. But when one was snatched, so
to say, from obscurity to the training table in
the middle of the season one had a right to be
a little elated and to cherish expectations. So,
at least, Dick thought, and so Stanley declared.</p>

<p>“You’re certain of playing part of the time in
the Kenwood game, Dick,” said Stanley. “Stone
is the only fellow you’ve got to be scared of, and
he isn’t going to last the game through. Cardin
is no better than you are now and I miss my guess
if you don’t come faster the rest of the season
than he does. And Pryne’s only so-so. As I
figure it out, you and Cardin are just about tied
for second choice quarter, and all you’ve got to
do is work like the dickens to beat him.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy the way you tell it,” laughed
Dick. “For that matter, all I’ve got to do is
to work like the dickens to cop a scholarship!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. ‘Copping’ a scholarship, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
so vulgarly phrase it, requires a certain amount
of grey matter in the garret. Winning a position
on a football team is merely a matter of physical
effort. No brains are necessary, my son.
Therefore, I back you against the field to get the
quarter-back job!”</p>

<p>“Thank you for nothing! At least, it requires
more brains to play football well then it does to
jump over a lot of silly hurdles!”</p>

<p>“There speaks ignorance,” retorted Stanley in
a superior and pitying tone. “There are just
three fairly decent hurdlers in this school, Dickie,
and there are at least half a hundred fairly decent
football players. Q.E.D.”</p>

<p>“Q.E. rot!” said Dick. “Anyone with skinny
legs and a pair of spiked shoes can jump fences,
you old swell-head! Besides, you don’t jump ’em
half the time: you just knock ’em over and get
tangled up in ’em. You track boys are a lot of
nuts, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Before you say something that I’ll have to resent,
Dick, I will change the subject for your
sake.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” grunted Dick derisively. “That’s what
everyone does when the argument goes against
them. Say, what’s Sandy Halden doing with you
fellows, Stan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was trying to be a half-miler last I knew,
but I saw him over with the jumpers Friday. You
and he made up yet?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t even seen him, except to pass him
in Parkinson. I guess, by the way, Billy didn’t
report that little mix-up last week.”</p>

<p>“I knew he wouldn’t. Billy’s all right: even if
he did tell me this afternoon that I took-off like
a steam-roller!”</p>

<p>“He’s very discerning,” murmured Dick.</p>

<p>Stanley shied a whisk-broom at him, and in the
subsequent fracas conversation languished.</p>

<p>Dick started at training table that evening and
found himself assigned to a seat at the substitute’s
board between Pryne and Bartlett, a
second-string guard. At the other table Coach
Driscoll presided, with Captain Bob facing him
at the farther end. At Dick’s table Stearns Whipple,
the manager, occupied the head. No one paid
any special attention to the newcomer as he took
his seat, although several smiled in a friendly way
and Pryne seemed glad to see him. Fellows had
a way of appearing suddenly at that table and
disappearing suddenly as well, and so a new face
occasioned little interest. Stanley had cheerfully,
almost gleefully, predicted that Dick would starve
to death at training table, and consequently Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was somewhat relieved to find the danger apparently
very remote. There was less to choose from,
and certain things that Dick was fond of, such
as pie and frosted cake, were noticeably absent,
but there was plenty of food nevertheless. To
make up for the pastry, there was ice-cream three
times a week instead of once, with a single rather
dry lady-finger tucked under the saucer. Steak
and chops and underdone beef and lamb formed
the basis of the meals, and with those viands went
a rather limited variety of vegetables. Eggs were
served at breakfast in lightly cooked condition
and milk was the regular three-times-a-day beverage
to the exclusion of coffee and tea.</p>

<p>It was on Thursday that Dick returned from
a hard practice to find a letter from his father
awaiting him. Mr. Bates wrote regularly each
week, usually on Sunday, so that his letter arrived
at school Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.
The present epistle was an extra one and Dick
opened it with some curiosity. When he had
read it through he was alternately smiling and
frowning. It wasn’t long, but it was emphatic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“Dear Dick:</p>

<p>“Every time I take up the <cite>Sentinel</cite> these days I
find a piece about you in it. How you did something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
or other in a football game and how proud
the town is of you. What I want to know is, do
you do anything at that school but play football.
I’m getting right-down tired of reading
about you. I sent you there to study and learn
things and get a good education and not to play
football and get your name in the papers all the
time like a prize-fighter. You buckle down and
attend to your work for a spell, that’s my advice
to you. If I keep on seeing where you’ve made
a home run or whatever it is I’m going to yank
you out of there plaguey quick. Folks keep asking
me have I seen where you did so and so and
ain’t I proud of you, and I tell them No, I ain’t
a blame bit proud, because I didn’t send you to
school to play games, but to make a man of yourself.
I hope you are well, as I am at the present
writing.</p>

<p class="noic">“Your aff. father,</p>

<p class="right">“Henry L. Bates.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dick read that letter to Stanley and Stanley
chuckled a good deal over it. “Of course he is
proud of you, just the same, Dick,” he said. “But
I dare say there’s something to be said for his
point of view. You’ll have to convince him that
you’re doing a bit of studying now and then on
the side, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose so. But he ought to know that if
I wasn’t keeping my end up in class I’d be hiking
home mighty quick! Maybe I ought to work
harder, Stan, and let football alone, but, gee,
a fellow’s got to do something besides
study!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you persuade the editor of that home
paper of yours to let up on you for awhile? How
do you do it, anyway? Nobody in my home ever
sees my doings in print. Got a drag with the
editor, or what?”</p>

<p>“It’s the High School <cite>Argus</cite>,” responded Dick
a trifle sheepishly. “The fellows that run it got
<cite>The Leader</cite> here to exchange with them and they
print everything about me they see in <cite>The Leader</cite>.
Of course that isn’t much: just the accounts of
the games: but the <cite>Argus</cite> fellows work it up and
then the <cite>Sentinel</cite> copies it. I—I wish they
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” Stanley grinned wickedly. “Yes,
you do! You’re tickled to death! So would I
be, Dickie. Tell you what: you sit down and write
a nice letter to your dad and tell him the facts
and make him understand that playing football
doesn’t incapacitate you for occasional attention
to studies. Or you might write a little piece about
how you stood highest in your class last month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and how teacher gave you a big red apple for it,
and send it to the town paper. That would please
your dad, wouldn’t it? And how about mentioning
that you’ve made the Banjo and Mandolin
Club? Think that would help any?”</p>

<p>“You go to the dickens,” grumbled Dick. “The
trouble is, dad’s easy-going as you like until he
gets his back up. Then you can’t argue with him
at all. He will do just as he says he will unless
I make him understand that I’m working as well
as playing. If,” he added ruefully, “he learned
about the Banjo and Mandolin Club he’d probably
send me a ticket home!”</p>

<p>“But you played football when you were in
high school, didn’t you? And did track work?
And was on the Glee Club, or whatever the fearful
thing was called?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I suppose I was sort of under dad’s
eye and he knew that I was getting along all right
in school. Being away off here, he sort of thinks
I’m being purely ornamental!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could think you ornamental,”
said Stanley soothingly. “Hasn’t he ever
seen you?”</p>

<p>“It’s all well enough for you to joke,” replied
Dick, grinning half-heartedly, “but you don’t know
my dad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell you what! Let me write and tell him
what a whale you are in class room. After he’d
read what I’d written he’d send you a letter of
apology, Dickie! I can see it now. ‘My dear son,
can you forgive me for my unjust and unworthy
doubts? Your—er—your estimable companion,
Mr. Gard, has written me the truth and I see now
how terribly I misjudged you. It makes me extremely
happy to know—to know that you have
Mr. Gard as a friend. He is, as I discern, a young
gentleman of great—er—mental attainment and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” laughed Dick. “You’d joke at
a funeral!”</p>

<p>“Not at my own, anyway! Well, cheer up, old
top, and hope for the worst. Then you’ll get the
best. If your father refuses to finance you I’ll
take up a collection and your loving friends
will see you through; at least, to the end
of the football season!” And Stanley chuckled
enjoyably.</p>

<p>Of course Dick answered that letter immediately
and spent the better part of an hour and much
ink trying to convince his father that in spite
of the evidence he was doing his full duty. Perhaps
he had secret qualms even as he wrote,
though, for it is a fact that from that day forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
he managed another hour of study, by hook or
by crook, and perceptibly improved his standing
in various classes. And finding time for more
study was less easy than it sounds, for the day
following his appearance at training table found
him accepted by coach and players as the second-choice
quarter-back, and if he had thought he
knew what hard work in practice meant he now
saw his mistake. For he was added to the select
coterie who remained on the field three or four
afternoons a week after the others had been dismissed
and who were drilled in punting and catching
until their legs ached and they saw a dozen
footballs where there was but one.</p>

<p>Guy Stone’s attitude toward Dick was peculiar,
or so Dick thought. He appeared to miss no opportunity
to chat with him and was very friendly,
but afterwards, thinking Stone’s conversation
over, Dick invariably found that the first-string
quarter had seemingly sought to instill self-doubting
and discouragement in his possible substitute.
One short conversation will do as an illustration.</p>

<p>“I see you take the snap-back almost facing
centre,” said Stone when they were on their way
to the gymnasium after a hard practice. “Think
you can work faster that way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I feel surer of the pass,” answered
Dick. “Do you think I ought to stand more sidewise?”</p>

<p>Stone looked doubtful. “I don’t know. Of
course, Dick, if you face your backs more you don’t
have to turn so far when you continue the pass.
It’s well to have the ball travel from centre to
runner on as straight a line as possible, you know.
If you take it so, and then have to turn like this
before you shoot it at the runner, you’re losing
time, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but only a fraction of a second, I’d
say. I do it that way because I can see the ball
better from the time centre starts the pass until
it’s in my hands. When I turn I just slip my
right foot around a few inches and swing on my
left. But if it’s better to stand sidewise to the
line——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not suggesting that you change now,”
protested Stone. “It’s always dangerous to
change your style of doing a thing as late in the
season as this. If you’d started earlier—but then
you may be right about it. You’re the doctor,
Dick. If you can do it better the way you are
doing it, I say keep on. Of course, in a real game
you’ll probably find sometime that your back
isn’t where you expect him and there’ll be a mix-up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
because when you’re excited you do funny
things. Take Gaines, now. He has a great way
of trying to beat the ball and goes loping away
from position before you’re ready to toss to him.
That means he has to slow up or lose the pass.
If you stand so you can see your backs as the
ball comes to you you know how to act. Of course,
when the pass is to the back direct, mistakes like
that can’t happen often, but Driscoll doesn’t fancy
the direct pass much.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think my way is correct and
you don’t think I ought to change it,” said Dick,
puzzled. “Mr. Driscoll has never said anything
about it being wrong.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I’m not saying it’s wrong,
either, am I? I think there’s a natural way for
everyone to do a thing, and that’s your natural
way. And I guess it wouldn’t be wise to try to
change now. All I do say is that you’re likely
to wish you had changed it some old day. But
I wouldn’t worry about it. I dare say you’ll muddle
through all right.”</p>

<p>When Dick mentioned the talk to Stanley the
latter laughed.</p>

<p>“Forget it, Dick,” he said. “Stone’s worried
for fear you may beat him out for the place.
Haven’t you any gumption!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beat him!” Dick exclaimed. “That’s likely,
I don’t think!”</p>

<p>“Well, convince him that it isn’t likely, and
you’ll find that he will stop talking that way.
Can’t you understand that if he can get you worried
enough you’ll fall off in your playing? He
isn’t afraid of Cardin, evidently, but he is of
you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Dick thoughtfully.
“Maybe that’s it, then. Just the same, there isn’t
a chance that I’ll beat him. I do think I’m doing
better work than Cardin, but Stone has it all over
me.”</p>

<p>“Now, yes, but maybe he thinks you’ll keep on
coming. How does Cardin take it, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Cardin? Oh, he doesn’t seem to mind. He’s
an awfully nice chap, Cardin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. But don’t fool yourself into thinking
he doesn’t care, Dick. It’s just he’s too decent
to let you see it. He’s a good loser; and
there aren’t many of that sort. I hope, whatever
happens, he’ll get his letter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so do I!” agreed Dick earnestly. “I do
like Cardin!”</p>

<small>IN CONFERENCE</small></h2>


<p>“I wish,” said Blash one evening, “that someone
would invent a new sport.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Sid. “Thinking of taking
a little exercise? Ever try checkers, Blash?
That’s about your style of a game.”</p>

<p>“Cease your idle chatter,” answered his room-mate
with dignity. “I’m not thinking of myself.
I’m thinking of Sandy Halden. Sandy is out of
a job again. They let him go from the Track
Team today. Billy Goode thinks the school can
worry along through the year without him as a
jumper or half-miler or shot-putter. Of course,
Billy’s probably mistaken, but there it is.”</p>

<p>“Just what was Sandy? A shot-putter or one
of the other things you mentioned?” Sid laid
down his pencil and tipped back squeakingly in
his chair. It was study hour in Number 27 Goss,
but Blash wasn’t in a studious mood.</p>

<p>“George Keene says he was broad-jumping the
last thing. He’d tried running, and maybe everything
else for all I know, and had got Billy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
let him try jumping. This afternoon, Keene says,
Sandy managed a perfectly marvellous jump of
eighteen feet or something and then claimed that
Hollaway, who had the tape, didn’t measure it
right. Claimed he’d done twenty-one even and
pointed to his foot-prints—only they happened to
be someone else’s—and was very nasty until
Hollaway offered to beat him to a pulp and Billy
gave him his time. So now Sandy is nursing a
new grouch and looking for new worlds to conquer.”
Blash yawned widely. “That’s why I
want a new sport. You see, Sid, Sandy has tried
everything now.”</p>

<p>“He might try canoeing and tip over,” suggested
Sid.</p>

<p>“Don’t be heartless. Besides, he can probably
swim!” Blash drummed his fingers on the edge
of the table until Sid, who had returned to work,
exclaimed protestingly. “Look here, what am I
going to do about Dick Bates?” asked Blash,
thrusting his hands into his pockets to make them
behave.</p>

<p>Sid pushed his book away and sighed in resignation.
“All right, hang you,” he said. “Go
ahead and talk yourself out, and when you’re
quite through I’ll finish this math. What about
Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why,” laughed Blash, “I owe him something.
You haven’t forgotten that hoax he worked on me
in the movie house, have you?”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!” Sid grinned. “That
was corking, Blash.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Well, yes, I acknowledge that it was.
And being corking, it demands a corking come-back.
But I can’t seem to see one. My powers
of—of invention——”</p>

<p>“You never had any. Why not forget it and
call quits? You put one over on Dick the day
you came up in the carriage with him, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was nothing. Purely impromptu, Sid.
What I want now is something—something grand
and magnificent, something worth while! Can you
think of anything?”</p>

<p>“No, and if I could I wouldn’t. You let Dick
alone until he’s through football. Your old tricks
will only get his mind off his work.”</p>

<p>“Think so? I wouldn’t want to worry him, Sid.
My idea is only to amuse him, to provide diversion.”
Blash was silent a moment and Sid, eyeing
him doubtfully, stretched a tentative hand
toward his book. But Blash wasn’t talked out
yet. He chuckled. “Stan told me something
funny about Dick yesterday,” he announced. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
seems that he’s a bit of a hero back home and his
high school paper has been copying everything
about him it could find in <cite>The Leader</cite> and playing
it up hard. Now his father is writing to ask him
if he doesn’t do anything here besides play football
and is threatening to take him out of school!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” Sid looked incredulous. “That’s
just one of Stan’s yarns.”</p>

<p>“Honest to coconuts, Sid! And Dick’s terribly
worried and is afraid the old man will learn that
he’s been taken into the Banjo and Mandolin Club.
Say if his father hears that, he’ll disown him!”</p>

<p>Sid laughed. “Must be a cranky old codger!
Most fathers would be rather proud, I guess. I
recall that mine slipped me a twenty-dollar check
when I wrote home that I’d been elected baseball
captain!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s different,” said Blash gently.
“You see, he’d never expected much from you,
Sid, and the surprise momentarily unnerved him.
And I suppose that by the time he’d pulled himself
together again and tried to stop payment on
that check you had it cashed.”</p>

<p>“I sure did,” laughed Sid. “And spent, too,
most of it!”</p>

<p>“I think I remember the occasion. Well, I’ve
been sort of dallying with the notion that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
might be a chance to get a rise out of Dick in
connection with his father’s—er—attitude. I
don’t just see my way clear yet, but—there’s an
idea floating around at the back of my brain——”</p>

<p>“It will probably die of loneliness,” said Sid
comfortingly, “so don’t trouble about it. Just
you take my advice and let Dick alone. I’ll tell
you right now that I shan’t help you in any of
your nefarious plots, Blash.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I think I’ll be able to work
this alone.” Blash stared thoughtfully at the
light and a slow smile overspread his lean countenance.
“Yes, I think I shall,” he added with conviction.</p>

<p>Sid looked across suspiciously. “I’ve a good
mind to warn him against you,” he said; “tell
him to look out for plots.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! You mind my own business. I’m not
going to hurt Dick. Besides, I—I haven’t got it
quite. It—it eludes muh!”</p>

<p>“I hope it’ll continue to elude you. Now, for
the love of Pete, shut up and let me study, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I didn’t ask you to stop studying.
Think your conversation is interesting to me? Go
on and study. I’m going to Sohmer.”</p>

<p>“Stan’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“I might drop in there. Come over when you’re
through with that rot. What you want to bother
with it for is more than I know, anyway. You’re
just making it harder for the rest of us!”</p>

<p>When, a half-hour later, Sid joined his room-mate
in Number 14 Sohmer, he found to his relief
three boys amicably and unemotionally discussing
the prospects of the college football teams.
Blash, however, looked horribly pleased and innocent,
and Sid’s suspicions returned. He always
suspected Blash when he looked innocent.</p>

<p>The St. Luke’s Academy game on the following
Saturday proved one of the best contests of the
season. The visitors usually gave an excellent
account of themselves, but the closeness of the
score on this occasion was a big surprise to
Parkinson. The best the home team could do in
the first half was to drop a single field-goal over
the cross-bar, and even that modest performance
was delayed until the second quarter was almost
over.</p>

<p>It was Newhall, the big right guard, who made
the tally possible by breaking through on St.
Luke’s thirty-two yards and spoiling a punt. The
pigskin bounded away from Newhall’s body as he
leaped into its path, and went trickling across the
sod. A dozen players pursued it but it was Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Peters who won, and when the pile-up was disentangled
it was found snuggled under his chest.
From the enemy’s twenty-eight to her eighteen
Gaines and Kirkendall alternated, the latter finally
making the last of the distance with only inches
to spare. Warden failed to gain and a quarter-back
run netted but three yards. With Kirkendall
back, on a fake kick, Gaines got through
right guard for three more. With four to go on
fourth down Kirkendall dropped the ball between
the uprights for the only score of the half.</p>

<p>St. Luke’s presented a heavy team and a most
aggressive one. From end to end, her line outweighed
Parkinson’s by many pounds, but weight
didn’t mean slowness in her case, and time and
again the visitors made gains by getting the jump
on their opponent. In the back-field she was
lighter but quite as fast as the Brown-and-White.
St. Luke’s suffered, however, as was generally
agreed, from a lack of good scoring plays. She
relied on weight and speed to break through the
enemy line and her reliance was not misplaced.
But she had not counted evidently on the excellent
defence put up by Parkinson’s back-field. Her
lighter backs, once through the line, were almost
invariably stopped short of conclusive gains. She
had almost nothing to offer in the way of variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and her runs outside tackles were weak. The
overhead game she let severely alone during the
first half of the contest and tried but four times
later. At punting, however, she excelled Kirkendall
by five yards and, in the last quarter, when
K went out, bested Gaines by fully eight.</p>

<p>The third period opened up with Parkinson kicking
off and St. Luke’s running the ball back from
her goal-line to her thirty-eight, Furniss missing a
tackle and Harris finally bringing the runner
down. St. Luke’s battered the Brown-and-White
for her distance, smashing through Cupp on the
left of centre for five yards and again for two and
completing her job by an unexpected slide off Wendell.
Once over the fifty-yard-line, however, she
failed to gain in four and punted to Warden on his
fifteen. Warden gained five. Kirkendall threw
Peters on his thirty-three and Bob was downed.
Off-side on the next play set Parkinson back and
three downs gained but six yards. Kirkendall
punted. St. Luke’s fumbled but recovered and
ran in twelve yards across the field. Parkinson’s
line failed to give and St. Luke’s tried her first
forward-pass. Although she managed to bunch
three men for the catch, the pass grounded. She
punted on the next down and Stone misjudged the
ball and followed it across the line for a touchback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
A few minutes later Warden got away around the
enemy’s left and zigzagged nearly twenty yards
before he was run out at his forty. A fake-kick,
with Kirkendall carrying the ball on a wide run
around the enemy’s right, added seven more and
Gaines made the distance on the fifty. With
Peters coming around from right end, Stone made
two through centre, and the same play, with Peters
carrying, gained four outside St. Luke’s left
end. A subsequent attempt by Gaines failed and
Parkinson punted. The kick went short and
cross the boundary at the enemy’s thirty-two
yards.</p>

<p>St. Luke’s made four around Furniss and failed
at the centre. She then tried her second forward-pass
and made it good, taking the ball just past
midfield. Scoville took Furniss’ place for Parkinson.
St. Luke’s tried out the new end and was
stopped for a two-yard loss. A cross-buck on right
tackle gave her four and her full-back romped
through a wide hole in Parkinson’s centre for eight.
St. Luke’s now concentrated on Newhall and Wendell
and made short gains, Newhall finally giving
up and going out in favour of Bartlett. The
Parkinson right side was weakening and the enemy
battered it hard and inched along to the Brown-and-White’s
twenty-nine. There a fumble cost her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a seven-yard loss. Faking a place-kick, her right
half took the ball through Wendell for six and it
was second down on Parkinson’s thirty. A plunge
at centre was stopped and again St. Luke’s prepared
to kick. This time the ball went to quarter
and that nimble youth romped ahead for the
needed distance and was downed on the twenty-five.</p>

<p>Two attempts at the right side gave the visitors
five yards and necessitated the substitution of
Cairns for Wendell. Cairns stopped a plunge at
his position and, on fourth down, with a tackle
back in kicking position, St. Luke’s made her distance
on a skin-tackle play that shot her left half
off Harris to Parkinson’s fourteen.</p>

<p>St. Luke’s ran on a fresh right tackle and a substitute
left half, and, for Parkinson, Long went in
for Gaines. With a tackle back and every indication
of a forward-pass, St. Luke’s smashed at the
Parkinson right side for three and repeated the
play for two more. From the nine yards the
enemy reached the three in two attacks at centre
and then hurling her whole back-field at Bartlett,
she sent her right tackle trickling around the
Parkinson left end. Warden nailed the runner
just short of the line, but couldn’t prevent a
score. It was a touchdown by less than a hand’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
breadth, but a touchdown nevertheless. St. Luke’s
failed on the punt-out and the score stood 6-3.</p>

<p>The period ended with the next play and Parkinson
made four changes. Gleason went in for
Cupp, Dean for Upton, Trask for Kirkendall and
Bates for Stone. St. Luke’s made two substitutions,
sending in a new centre and a new
full-back.</p>

<p>Dick carried instructions from Mr. Driscoll to
open up the play, and Trask, standing on his
twenty-four yards, sent off a forward-pass to
Peters well up the field. Peters touched the pigskin
but couldn’t hold it. The same play to the
other side of the field, Trask to Long, netted
eighteen yards. Dick sent a plunge at the St.
Luke’s right side but Trask made only a yard.
Warden ripped off four outside left tackle. A
forward-pass, Trask to Scoville, added twelve,
Scoville being downed where he caught. Three
line plunges left Parkinson three yards short of
her distance and Trask punted short to the
enemy’s seventeen.</p>

<p>St. Luke’s tried the Parkinson ends and gained
five in two downs and punted to midfield, the ball
going out. Dick was getting more speed into the
team than it had shown before and St. Luke’s was
finding the attacks at her line harder to stop. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
weak spot developed at the St. Luke’s right tackle
and thrice Warden and Trask plunged through for
gains. In eight downs Parkinson advanced to the
enemy’s twenty-eight yards. There, with Trask
back in kicking position, Dick scurried around the
St. Luke’s left end and found a free field to her
twelve, where he was tackled by the quarter just
inside the boundary. The ball was outside on the
next play and was paced in on the eleven yards.
Warden slid off right tackle for three and put the
pigskin down in front of the right-hand goal-post.
With Cairns back as though to kick, Dick tossed
the ball to Long and Long shot it across the line
to Peters for a touchdown. Parkinson arose in
the stand and howled approval.</p>

<p>And that ended the scoring. Coach Driscoll ran
on numerous second- and third-string players in
the final four minutes and the game became hectic
and uncertain, with several penalties and two
costly fumbles, shared by the two teams, and Dick
having heart-failure every time he called his signals.
But, although St. Luke’s worked her way
back to Parkinson’s thirty-five yards and looked
formidable, the defenders took the ball away before
she could try a field-goal and punted out
of danger. And before the enemy could start another
advance the whistle blew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, both teams played good football,
and there were plenty who maintained that, given
a half-dozen tricky plays, St. Luke’s would have
scored a victory. Of course Parkinson had shown
plenty of weak spots. For three periods she had
been slow in the line and not much faster behind
it. Newhall had made a poor showing against St.
Luke’s left guard and Furniss, at left end, had had
an off-day. Stone had sometimes chosen the
wrong plays. But everything considered Parkinson
had proved herself a powerful team and shown
considerable improvement over her performance
of a week ago.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s best-beloved rival Kenwood, had
had a season of ups and downs and, as Coach
Driscoll said at the first conference following the
St. Luke’s game, there was no telling what sort
of a team she would present against Parkinson on
the twenty-third of November. She had been
decisively beaten in mid-season by Bonright
School, had turned around a week later and
slammed Wainstow to the tune of 26-0, had
been tied by Musket Hill and now, on Saturday
last, had just nosed out a victory over Chancellor.</p>

<p>“She’s got good material,” said Mr. Driscoll,
“but it isn’t running true to form. And she’s had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
some hard luck, too. Losing her best back, Shotwell,
early in the season was against her. But the
chief trouble, as I see it, is that she doesn’t seem to
have settled on a definite playing policy, unless
she’s done it within the week. She started out
with light backs and a lot of fast, clever trick plays
that worked all right until she ran up against Bonright.
Bonright seems to have beaten her at her
own game. After that she laid off heavy Browne
and that other half, whatever his name was, and
took on two heavy men and started in playing a
line game, smashing tandems between tackles and
using a very good forward-pass with two men receiving.
But she hasn’t developed a dependable
goal-kicker yet, unless she’s got someone in hiding.
Nutting missed two tries, both easy, on
Saturday. So, as I say, there’s no such thing as
sizing her up. Of course, we may get a sort
of a line on her after we’ve met Chancellor
this week, but I don’t expect much that will help
us.”</p>

<p>“It never seems to make much difference how
Kenwood plays during the season,” observed
Stearns Whipple. “She’s always top-of-form
when she gets to us!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have one advantage, anyhow,” said Bob
Peters. “We’ve come along pretty steady and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
what we know we’ve learned. Kenwood has sort
of gone one step forward and two back, and she
doesn’t know just where she’s at, I guess. What
about her condition, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s got a first-class trainer in Connell
and he will do his part all right. You mustn’t
look for any advantage there, Cap. Her men will
be in condition all right. As good as ours, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll outpunt her, Coach,” said Stone.</p>

<p>“With Kirkendall in, yes. But that man of
hers, Brighouse, has a clever foot. And he puts
his punts where he wants them to go, I hear. We
may outdistance him a few yards, but a lot depends
on the wind. I have a sort of a hunch, fellows,
that Kenwood is keeping something up her sleeve.
I can’t tell you why I think that, or what the something
is, but that’s my hunch.”</p>

<p>“And your hunches are generally right,” mused
Peters. “Any second-string fellow that looks as
if he was being held back? A clever back-field
man, for instance?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t found any. No, I think it’s a goal-kicker,
or maybe they’ve got a new scoring play
that they haven’t shown. Well, I’m only guessing.
We’ll know better a week from Saturday.
Now let’s do some planning on the week from now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to Thursday. We’ve got to buckle down and find
a way of getting some punch into those split-plays.
Or else drop them. What’s your idea, Cap?”</p>

<p>Whereupon the meeting became very technical
and abstruse.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates’ reply to Dick’s letter was contained in
his regular weekly epistle and was decidedly non-committal.
He appeared to accept Dick’s statements
as to the latter’s studiousness and progress
but made little comment. Only, a mail later than
the letter, came two copies of the Leonardville
daily, each with a paragraph circled in red ink.
Seeing them, Dick sighed and shook his head even
before he read them. Thursday’s paper held the
following under the caption “High School Jottings”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Richard C. Bates, for two years one of High
School’s most popular students, is certainly making
good at his new Alma Mater, Parkinson
School, which he entered last September. Dick
went out for the Parkinson Football Team and
proceeded to show them how the position of
quarter-back should be played. Now he is first
substitute, we learn, and the season isn’t over yet.
Dick’s loss was a severe blow to the High School<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Team, but his old friends are surely proud of his
success and are rooting hard for him.”</p></div>

<p>Dick shuddered over that and took up the second
paper. “Leonardville is Proud of Him,” he read.
“Richard Corliss Bates, the younger son of our
prominent citizen and successful merchant, Mr.
Henry L. Bates, of Euclid Boulevard, is a fine
example of the coming citizens of Leonardville.
Young Bates is well and favourably known to a
wide circle of friends in this city who will be
pleased to learn of his success in the various
branches of his career at Parkinson School,
Warne, Mass., of which famous institution of
learning he became a student in September last.
While attending the local High School Richard
Bates was unusually popular, both for his personal
traits and for the brilliancy displayed by
him in athletics. As a football player he was
easily supreme in this part of the State and his
prowess was recognised widely. A number of
schools and colleges sought his services but young
Bates chose the school which his brother, Stuart
Bates, now of Philadelphia, attended. There, in
the short space of two months, Richard has already
made his presence felt and is in a fair way
to attain renown both for scholastic attainments
and athletic supremacy. He entered into competition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
at the beginning of the school year for the
position of quarter-back on the School Football
Team, an honor for which there were dozens of
contenders, and now holds the place of first substitute,
with every indication of becoming the regular
incumbent of the position before the football
season ends. He has also recently been elected to
membership in one of the school’s most exclusive
organizations, the Banjo and Mandolin Club, to
which, because of a rare musical talent, he will
doubtless prove a valuable addition. In his classes
Richard stands high. There is, we understand,
talk amongst his friends in the High School of
organising a party to go to Warne on the occasion
of the Parkinson-Kenwood football game, which is
held the Saturday before Thanksgiving, to see him
play and to do honour to one who is so pleasingly
upholding the traditions of Leonardville young
manhood. His career will be watched with sympathetic
interest by a host of well-wishers in our
fair city.”</p>

<p>Having completed the reading of that, Dick not
only shuddered again but groaned loudly, so loudly
that Stanley, at the table, looked up from his
studies and viewed him with alarm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Stanley.</p>

<p>“It’s that rotten paper again,” moaned Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
casting the offending sheet to the floor and turning
a disheartened gaze to the window. Stanley
smiled, pulled the paper toward him dexterously
with one foot, rescued it and read. And as he
read he chuckled, and Dick, seeing what was
happening, made a dash to wrest the paper
away.</p>

<p>“No, get out of here! Let me read it, you
simp!” Stanley fended Dick off with feet and one
hand. “Everybody else has,” he laughed, “so
why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>Dick scowled, shrugged, thrust his hands into
his pockets and subsided on the window-seat. “Go
ahead then,” he muttered. “But if you laugh I’ll
kill you!”</p>

<p>So Stanley put the paper between them
and made no sound, although certain twitchings
of his hands aroused the other’s suspicions.
When he was through Stanley lowered
the paper from in front of a very serious countenance.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Dick morosely. “Say it, you
chump!”</p>

<p>“Why, I—well, of course, Dickie, it’s a bit—a
bit fulsome, you know, but I can’t see anything
in it to be mad about.”</p>

<p>“You can’t, eh? Well, I can! What do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
suppose dad thinks when he reads that sort of
piffle? No wonder he wasn’t more—more cordial
in his letter!”</p>

<p>“But the paper says a lot of very nice things
about you, Dick,” protested Stanley. “That about
the exclusive Banjo and Mando——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” growled Dick. “They make me
sick.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure,” pursued the other gravely,
“any fellow would be flattered at having his
friends come all the way from Pennsylvania to see
him play in the big game.”</p>

<p>“Huh! That’s only guff, thank goodness! Gee,
if that happened——”</p>

<p>“But this paper says it’s likely to happen,”
Stanley objected. “If it was me, I’d be pleased
purple!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you would!” jeered Dick. “Someone’s
been filling that newspaper chap with a lot of
hot air. That’s the sort of stuff they print about
anyone that—that does anything; like moving
away or dying or—or getting married. It doesn’t
mean anything, but the trouble is that dad has seen
it and I’ll bet he believed it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Besides, it says here ‘In his classes
Richard stands high.’ That ought to please him,
anyway!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to know what they know about my
classes. The whole thing’s sickening.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” murmured Stanley judicially,
casting his eyes down the column again.
“Say, you never told me that ‘a number of schools
and colleges’ were after you, old man. That’s hot
stuff! You’ve been hiding your bush under a
lightning.”</p>

<p>“Well, they really were, Stan, but I didn’t brag
of it. Not here, anyway. I did show the letters to
Blash one time when he was here, just as a sort
of joke. But I don’t see how the paper got hold
of it. I suppose Sumner White blabbed.”</p>

<p>“Well, cheer up, Dickie. Folks may not think
you wrote that yourself. There’s always that
chance. Even if they do——”</p>

<p>“Stan! Does it—does it sound as if I’d—I’d
done it?”</p>

<p>“N-no, only the election to the Banjo——”</p>

<p>“The High School <cite>Argus</cite> got that from <cite>The
Leader</cite>, you idiot! I suppose the guy that wrote
all this drivel found it in the <cite>Argus</cite> and just—just
dilated on it.”</p>

<p>“Dilated is good,” chuckled Stanley. “Whoever
he is, I’d say he delights to dilate. Well, cut
it out and paste it in your scrap-book, Dick. It’ll
interest your grandchildren some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will!” declared Dick venomously. He
seized the paper and tore it into shreds and then
cast it from him into the general direction of the
waste-basket. “Like fun!”</p>

<p>“When—er—that is, how many do you think
there’ll be in the party, Dick?” asked Stanley innocently.</p>

<p>“What party?” Dick scowled his puzzlement.</p>

<p>“Why, the party that’s coming on to see
you——”</p>

<p>But he didn’t finish, for Dick was on him like a
whirlwind, the chair went over backward—Stanley
accompanying it—and there was a rough time
in Number 14 for the ensuing four minutes. At
the end of that time Dick sat astride Stanley’s
chest and demanded apologies, and Stanley, weak
from laughing, gave in. “Just the same,” he
added, wiping his eyes as he scrambled to his feet
again, “just the same, Dick, I think you ought to
make some sort of plans for their entertainment—All
right! All right! I won’t open my mouth
again! I was just thinking——”</p>

<p>“Don’t think!” ordered Dick sternly. “Sit
down there and help me write a letter to that editor
man that’ll blister his hide and make him let
me alone after this! Come on now. How would
you begin it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>In the end it turned out to be a very brief and
very formal and extremely polite epistle which
thanked the Leonardville <cite>Sentinel</cite> for its interest
but requested that hereafter Mr. Richard Bates’s
name be excluded from its columns since Mr.
Richard Bates disliked publicity.</p>

<p>“Great stuff!” commented Stanley when Dick
had read over the final draft. “Sounds so fine
and modest. Hadn’t you better enclose a check
for that write-up, though? You don’t want him
to think——”</p>

<p>Stanley, however, was now looking into the
muzzle of a paper-weight, so to speak, and his
words dwindled to silence. Dick, cowing him further
with a sustained glare, replaced the paper-weight
and directed an envelope. When the letter
was sealed and stamped Dick again fixed his companion
with a ferocious and intimidating look.
“You keep quiet about this, Stan,” he said, “or
I’ll bust you all up into a total loss! Understand?”
Stanley nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, say so then!”</p>

<p>“Dick, you have my sacred word of honour that
never so long as I do live will I so much as breathe
a single syllabub of this thing save that I do have
your permission to so do, though wild hearses
drag my body asunder and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! But you remember! If I find
you’ve told Blash or—or anyone I’ll lick you,
Stan!”</p>

<p>“I hear and I obey in fear and trembling,” responded
Stanley humbly. “Least of all will I ever
divulge a word to that exclusive organization, the
Banjo and Mandolin Club, Dick! And if you want
any assistance in entertaining——”</p>

<p>Stanley beat the paper-weight to the door by
one fifth of a second, establishing what was undoubtedly
a record over the course!</p>

<p>Dick mailed the letter to the editor of the <cite>Sentinel</cite>
and tried to dismiss the annoying affair from
memory. In this effort he was well aided by
Coach Driscoll, for the coach didn’t allow him
much time that week for vain regretting. Dick
and Stone were alternated in practice every day
and none could have said with any degree of certainty
that either was the favourite. Cardin was
quite evidently relegated to third place, in token
of which he drove B Squad around the field in
signal drill while Dick and Gus Stone confined
their attentions to A. The Second Team was
licked to a frazzle on Tuesday in a thirty-minute
session, was held scoreless on Wednesday, although
given the ball eight times on the First’s
ten-yard-line, and was again decisively beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Thursday. On Friday the First Team went
through signals and did some punting and catching
and then were sent back to the showers. But
work was no longer over when twilight fell these
days, for there was an hour of black-board talk
in the gymnasium Trophy Room after supper each
night. There, with the squad seated on some old
yellow settees dragged in from the balcony, Coach
Driscoll, with chalk and eraser and pointing finger,
explained and questioned. On Friday night Mr.
Driscoll talked defence against shifts, first chalking
his diagram on the black surface beside him.</p>

<p>“Chancellor uses several forms of shift plays,”
he began. “For a punt she uses a tackle-over.
You know how to meet that, I think, but we’ll
go over it again to refresh your memories. When
you see the opponent shifting a tackle to either
side you must yourselves shift a full space in
that direction. I’m speaking to the five centre
men now. Suppose Chancellor calls for ‘tackle-over
left.’ Centre, guards and tackles move a
space to the left. That brings centre opposite the
opposing right guard and left guard opposite the
opposing right tackle, as shown on the board.
Our left tackle is out here opposite their right end,
our left end still further out where he can dash
around to spoil the kick—if he’s smart enough!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Right end stays well out and a little back of the
line, and it’s his duty to spot fakes and give the
news the moment he does it. If a forward-pass
develops on his side his place is under the ball.
Right half-back plays about three yards back, between
his guard and tackle. Full-back occupies
a similar position on the other side, ready to go in
or out, as play develops. He and left tackle must
look after the opposing tackle and end. Behind
him, more to the right and well back, is the left
half. The quarter, of course, is up the field.
Chancellor will almost always punt from that formation,
but she may fake, and it is those fakes
you must watch out for. Full-back must be especially
alive. He must watch the enemy’s back-field
and her right end too. If the latter goes out
to receive a pass he must get to him promptly and
block him. On the other hand, if a punt comes, as
it is likely to nine times in ten, this defence puts
three men where they ought to be able to sift
through in time to hurry the punter if not to
actually block the kick. And if you can hurry
the punter, in Chancellor’s case her left half-back,
you are doing something. For ‘tackle-over
right’ you merely reverse this diagram. Chancellor
will sometimes punt from ordinary formation
to fool you, but not often, for her punter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
likes plenty of room. Now, fellows, are there any
questions? Let’s have this perfectly understood,
for it’s a formation you’ll have to use often tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Sometimes they adjourned to the gymnasium
floor and lined up and then walked through the
evolutions of some play not clearly understandable
in the Trophy Room. After these evening
séances Dick, for one, was likely to have much
difficulty in getting to sleep, his mind being a weird
confusion of plays and signals.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>ON THE SCREEN</small></h2>


<p>Parkinson played Chancellor on the latter’s home
field this year, and a good half of the school accompanied
the team to Mount Wansett Saturday
morning. Dick, of course, went with the squad
of twenty-one players that left on the ten-forty-three
train, and others of our acquaintance followed
after an early dinner, reaching Mount Wansett
with just time to reach the field before Babe
Upton kicked off. The line-up for the visitors at
the start was, with one exception, what it would
be for the Kenwood game a week later. Gleason
was at left guard in place of Cupp, the latter being
out because of a bad ankle. Stone started at
quarter-back and played a good defensive game
but was, as usual, slow in getting at the attack.
Toward the last of the second period, when Parkinson
had finally worked the ball down to Chancellor’s
twenty-seven yards, Dick took his place,
bearing instructions to try a forward-pass and,
should that fail, to score on a field-goal. Stone
had been intent on hammering the enemy line for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a touchdown, without apparently realising that
Chancellor was getting more invulnerable with
every plunge and that time was working in her
behalf. The attempt at a forward almost succeeded,
but not quite, and on third down, standing
on Chancellor’s thirty-five-yard line, Kirkendall
dropped a pretty goal directly over the centre of
the bar. That was the only score of the half,
and it was becoming apparent to Parkinson rooters
why Kenwood had been able to win from Chancellor
by only one score, and that a field goal.</p>

<p>To Dick’s surprise, Cardin started the third
period, and played an excellent game. In fact it
was due to Cardin that Parkinson secured a second
score soon after play was resumed. A muffed
punt on Chancellor’s twenty yards had been captured
by Bob Peters and two plunges had carried
the pigskin on to the fourteen yards. There, however,
a mass attack on the left of the home team’s
right tackle had resulted in no gain and a try-at-goal
seemed necessary, with the probabilities
against success since the ball was at a wide angle
with the goal. Cardin solved the difficulty by
faking a kick and, after hiding the ball until the
Chancellor line had broken through, dodging his
way around the enemy’s left for enough ground to
secure the down. From there Kirkendall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Warden had alternated and had eventually carried
the ball across.</p>

<p>Later, Chancellor, not for a moment acknowledging
defeat, pulled off two long forward-passes that
took her from her own thirty yards to Parkinson’s
twenty-eight. Two line attacks netted five more
and a third was stopped for no gain. Then a long-legged
back put a neat field-goal over for the home
team’s first score. Dick went back at the beginning
of the final quarter and, with a line-up consisting
largely of second- and third-string players,
did his best to hold the enemy at bay, and succeeded,
although there were some heart-stirring
moments for the visiting audience. When the last
whistle blew the score was 10-3 in Parkinson’s
favour and she had the satisfaction of having bettered
Kenwood’s performance against the opponent.
For Chancellor had scored a touchdown
against the Blue but had failed to seriously
threaten the Parkinson goal-line. At that, however,
the Brown-and-White’s superiority over the
Blue was still questionable, and wise prophets refused
to be unduly optimistic as to next Saturday’s
contest.</p>

<p>When Dick arrived home long after six o’clock
and made a hurried trip to Sohmer to leave his
suit-case and prepare sketchily for supper, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
found a letter awaiting him. It was from Sumner
White, he saw, and he concluded that it could
wait until after supper. But, at the last moment,
he seized on it as he hurried out of the room and
tore the envelope open as he took the stairs three
at a time, and skimmed the first page on the way
along the Yard to Alumni Hall. At the bottom of
the page he came on something that brought him
up standing. With a perplexed frown he started
back and re-read the beginning.</p>

<p>“I suppose you saw what we did to Norristown
(Sumner wrote.) It was a corking game and Sid
Nellis got his wrist broken and a lot more of us
got pretty well scrapped. The score was 14 to 6,
but we sure had to work for it. Jim Cleary played
most of the game at full-back and was a wonder,
better than Ed ever was. But I guess you read all
this. The big news is that three or four of us,
maybe more, will be over on the twenty-third to
see you play in the Kenwood game. Charlie Stone
and Will Meens and Theo Harris and I sure, and
maybe Cleary and Townsend. I guess you saw the
swell articles in the <cite>Sentinel</cite> last week. I meant to
send you a copy, but it got lost, and anyway I
guess your father saw to it. I met him on High
Street a couple of days ago and he asked me what
I knew about that article and I said nothing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
he said it was confounded nonsense, but he acted
like he thought it was pretty fine just the same,
Dick. We’re coming over on the midnight from
Philly and that will get us to Warne about noon
Saturday. Lucky we haven’t any Saturday game,
isn’t it? We hold last real practice Friday and
then only do some signal drills Monday and Tuesday.
So we have lots of time. Charlie Stone’s
old man is sort of financing the trip, he and Mr.
Harris, but we are all paying part. You mustn’t
put yourself out on our account, for we know you’ll
be awfully tied down that day. But we’ll dig
around to your room when we get in and see you
for a few minutes. Then maybe after the game
we can have a good chin. Great, isn’t it? Gee,
I’m crazy about it. Hope you whale Kenwood
good. I’ll write again about Wednesday and let
you know if any other fellows are going. A
lot of them want to only they haven’t got the
coin.”</p>

<p>Dick read that remarkable letter over twice and
then stuffing it into a pocket, took up his hurried
journey again. He didn’t know whether to be
pleased or peeved. Of course, it was flattering
that his old team-mates should want to come all
that way to see him play, and he supposed he
really appreciated it, but somehow it made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
feel sort of foolish too. It wasn’t as if he was the
captain, or even the first-choice quarter. If fellows
here in Parkinson heard of it they’d think
him beastly conceited and probably laugh like anything.
Besides, hang it all, how did he know he
would even get in on Saturday? Suppose Stone
played the game right through! Of course, the
coach would probably let him in for a minute or
two at the end, just as he would Cardin, to get his
letter, but what a fool he would feel in that case!
Folks coming all the way from Leonardville, Pennsylvania,
to see him do stunts and he sitting on the
bench all the time! Gee, that would be fierce! He
wished Sumner White and Charlie and all the
others, especially including the editor of the
<cite>Sentinel</cite>, would mind their own business! He was
hungry enough for supper to forget the letter in
his pocket save at infrequent intervals. When he
did recall it the pucker returned to his forehead
and he thrust a hand over the offending missive to
be sure that it hadn’t got away. It would be awful
if he dropped it and someone picked it up and
read it!</p>

<p>Stanley and Blash and Rusty and he had arranged
for a movie party that night. The idea
had been Blash’s and Dick had at first declined to
go, pleading that he would be too tired and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
besides, he had a lot of studying that ought to be
done. But he had been persuaded to go, and so he
got through supper rather hurriedly, knowing that
the others would be waiting. He wanted to read
that awful letter to Stanley and ask advice and
sympathy, but he would have to wait until they got
back from the movie house. On the way there he
was silent, and Rusty, walking beside him, rallied
him on his “pensivity.” Dick was tempted to
confide in Rusty, but he resisted, perhaps wisely,
and only responded that he was tired. As a matter
of truth, he was, for even had he not played a
minute, the trip was sufficient to weary one.</p>

<p>“Well, the movies will rest you,” answered
Rusty gaily. “They do me, always, Dick. After
I’ve studied too hard or anything I can go to a
movie house and get rested wonderfully. You see,
you have your mind taken from your worries, and
you sort of relax your body and there you are!
Besides, Dick, it’s a corking good picture tonight.
And then there’s the weekly review. I
like that about as well as anything, I think. ‘Bath,
Maine; Largest schooner afloat is launched from
yard of the builders with appropriate ceremonies.’
‘Miss Mary Ellen Dingbottle, daughter
of Senator Hiram Dingbottle, breaks a bottle of
tomato catsup over the bow.’ ‘In her native element!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
‘Los Angeles, Cal., Harold Whosthis,
America’s favourite moving picture star, signs
contract calling for largest salary ever paid to an
actor.’ ‘Tie Siding, Wyoming. Members of
Boys’ and Girls’ Hog Club hold annual parade.’
‘Procession passing in review before Mayor
Scrugg and invited guests.’ ‘Little Willie Dingfingle
and his prize porker: Willie is at the left
of the picture.’ ‘Minneapolis, Minn. Fire destroys
million-dollar barber-shop.’ ‘Firemen
fighting flames as hundreds of celluloid combs explode.’
‘New York City. Twelve thousand——’”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” laughed Dick. “That’s awfully like
it, though! And the picture of the burning barber-shop
is thrown on the screen in red.”</p>

<p>“Always! Just as a picture of the Whirlpool
Rapids taken from an airplane is always blue.
There are certain laws that can’t be—Well, here
we are. Keep your hand out of your pocket, Dick.
This is Blash’s treat. When Blash shows the least
sign of paying for anything, for the love of mud
don’t stop him! I’m all for the encouragement of
miracles! Better get ’em reserved, Blash; there’ll
be a crowd tonight!” And Rusty winked gravely
at Dick.</p>

<p>Blash, however, paid no attention to the disinterested
advice, but bought the usual tickets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the quartette made their way into the darkened
theatre and peered about for seats. Fortunately,
Rusty’s prophecy proved false and there were
plenty of vacancies. There did not, though, appear
to be four together, and while Dick suggested
sitting in pairs none of the others seemed to
like the notion. “Oh, no,” whispered Stanley,
“let’s keep together. It’s more fun. There’ll be
seats in a minute or two.”</p>

<p>“I see four now,” said Rusty. “On the side
there, pretty well front. Come on!”</p>

<p>Dick thought them rather too close to the screen
when he was finally seated between Blash and
Rusty, with Stanley beyond the latter, but the
others declared them to be just right. As Blash
was usually a stickler for sitting well back, Dick
was slightly puzzled. The first show was almost
over and they witnessed the final exploits of Dick’s
favourite movie hero through half a reel, pretending
not to look. Then the house lighted and a brief
intermission ensued.</p>

<p>“I do hope they have a good weekly tonight,”
observed Rusty, “don’t you, Blash?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the other, rewarding the questioner
with a scowl that Dick saw and didn’t
understand. Beyond Rusty, toward the aisle,
Stanley was grinning widely. Dick began to experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the uncomfortable feeling that the others
were enjoying a joke that he was not in on, and
to wonder if the joke was on him! Then the lights
were lowered, an ornate “Welcome” flashed on the
screen, the piano began its jig-time music and the
weekly review of current events started. There
were the usual scenes, so like Rusty’s travesty
that Dick had to smile. There happened to be no
ship launching on this occasion, but there was a
series of views aboard a United States warship
during target practice, and there was a gorgeous
fire, thrown on in crimson hues, and Rusty’s parade
of the Hog Club was overlooked in favour of
a poultry show. Then came the ingenious trademark
at the finish and Dick settled back to enjoy
the comedy. But the weekly appeared to have
taken a new lease of life, for another title flashed
on the screen. Dick read idly and then jumped forward
in his seat and read again, his eyes fairly
popping from his head, read incredulously and
amazedly the legend trembling on the white background:</p>

<p class="noic">TOWN HONOURS HER HERO</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Leonardville, Pa.—Twenty thousand citizens in
monster outdoor meeting pay tribute to famous
athlete, Richard Corliss Bates.</p></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>BLASH EVENS THE SCORE</small></h2>


<p>While Dick still stared, unable to believe his eyes,
the title whisked itself away and a picture took its
place. A sea of upturned faces surrounded a flag-draped
stand on which a large gentleman was
gesticulating. Seated figures flanked him and on
every haughty chest fluttered a ribbon badge. In
the background what looked to be a mile-long factory
building stretched. There was an outburst
of cheering and waving from the throng, the
speaker smiled benevolently and the picture faded
from sight!</p>

<p>Not until then was Dick aware of the absorbed
regard of his companions. Turning amazedly he
looked into the eloquent countenance of Blash.
“You never told us!” exclaimed Blash in an awed
and choking voice, and: “Oh, Dick!” whispered
Rusty hoarsely. “Ain’t it grand?”</p>

<p>For one dazed, blank moment Dick stared back
into Blash’s strangely working face. Then the
light dawned. He gave a gasp and——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop it, Dick!” gurgled Blash. “We’ll be
put out, you s-s-silly ass! Grab him, Rusty!”</p>

<p>And Rusty grabbed him and, breathing heavily,
he was forced back into his seat.</p>

<p>“Be good!” begged Rusty in a strangled voice.
“Remember you’ve g-g-ot a reputat-repu—<em>Oh,
gosh!</em>”</p>

<p>“As a public character,” began Blash. “<em>Quit
it!</em> There’s an usher coming, Dick! Be good,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—I—I’ll break every bone in your body,”
sputtered Dick. “I’——”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble there?” asked a stern voice
from the aisle. “You’ll have to cut out that
noise, fellows, or leave the theatre.”</p>

<p>“It—it’s all right, Usher,” panted Blash.
“The—my friend had a slight attack of—of——”</p>

<p>“Vertigo,” supplied Stanley. “He’s all right
now. Feel better, Dick? Yes, he says he feels
better, thanks.”</p>

<p>“You let go me,” growled Dick, writhing in
the grasp of Blash and Rusty. “What do I care
about the usher? Let go my arms, you pups!”</p>

<p>“Just keep your eyes closed,” said Rusty
soothingly. “You’ll be all right in a second. I’ve
got an aunt who’s just that way. Every time she
goes to the movies——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hang your aunt!” exploded Dick. “I tell you
to let go of me!”</p>

<p>The usher flashed a suspicious beam from his
pocket-torch on the convulsed features and muttered
doubtfully: “Looks to me like he was havin’
a fit!”</p>

<p>“Usher! Usher, there’s nothing the matter with
him!” exclaimed an indignant voice from the row
behind. “Those boys have been acting up ever
since they came in, and you ought to make them
behave. It’s no pleasure for others to have to be
annoyed like this and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam!” exclaimed Blash, turning an injured
countenance. “How can you say so? I
assure you——”</p>

<p>“You tell your friend to come out of it,” said
the usher doggedly. “Either that or you all get
out! That goes, see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks so much,” said Stanley gratefully.
“He’s quite all right now. You’re all right, aren’t
you, Dick? Yes, he says he’s feeling ever so much
better. Maybe——”</p>

<p>“O you Bates!” cried a voice from across
the darkened house. “O you famous athlete!”
Laughs and chuckles followed. The usher gazed
about him bewilderedly. From the balcony came
a further interruption. “What did you pay for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Dick?” inquired an earnest voice. Laughter unrestrained
arose from many quarters. A shrill
falsetto joined in. “Regular cheers for Bates,
fellows! One, two, three!” Someone accepted
the challenge and, interspersed with laughter, a
ragged Parkinson cheer broke forth: “Rah, rah,
rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Bates!
<em>Bates!</em> BATES!” And, “<em>Hero!</em>” added a solitary
voice upstairs. Dick slumped into his seat,
all fight gone from him.</p>

<p>Three ushers, reinforced by a stout gentleman
from the front, hurried along the aisles and
begged or commanded silence, and gradually the
laughter subsided to chuckles and the chuckles died
away. Blash whispered contritely in Dick’s ear:
“Sorry if I’ve made you mad, Dick. It was just a
joke, you know. Thought you’d take it like a
good sport.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dick glumly. “Shut up,
please.”</p>

<p>The comedy was half finished and Dick tried
hard to put his thoughts on the humours of it but
met with scant success. He blamed Stanley for
breaking his promise and telling Blash about that
article in the Leonardville <cite>Sentinel</cite> and about
Sumner White’s letter. For of course he had told
Blash. Otherwise, how could Blash have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and have concocted that horrible joke? Gradually
resentment against Blash—and Rusty, too,
since it was apparent that Rusty had known beforehand—waned,
for, after all, it was nothing to
get angry about. Blash had merely paid him back
in his own coin, a little more cleverly. Dick even
found heart to grin once in the darkness and to
wonder how Blash had managed to persuade the
movie manager to present the ridiculous thing!
But Stanley—Dick scowled. He wouldn’t forgive
Stan very soon!</p>

<p>Of course he wouldn’t hear the last of it for a
long time. Evidently Parkinson fellows were scattered
freely through the house and every one of
them would return to school with a hilarious version
of the incident. Well, that didn’t matter. A
fellow had to take jokes as well as perpetrate them,
and after awhile it would be forgotten. But Stanley
had no business to tell. Dick was firm as to
that. When the feature picture came on Dick had
recovered his equanimity and was able to enjoy it,
although he took pleasure in letting Blash and
Rusty remain in ignorance of his forgiveness.
Afterwards, going out, he had to play the good
sport and meet the laughing gibes of acquaintances
with smiling unconcern, but he was glad when they
were in the less brilliant stretch of School Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
He purposely avoided Stanley and chose Blash as
his companion on the way back to school. Blash
was inclined to be apologetic and remorseful.</p>

<p>“Maybe it wasn’t so pesky smart, after all,
Dick,” he said. “I didn’t think about the other
fellows being there. I’m afraid you’ll get a lot
of ragging.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” answered Dick. “You had
to when we sprung that one on you, you know.
But how the dickens did you work it, Blash?
Honest, I thought I was seeing things when they
flashed that rot on the screen! Thought my—my
mind had given way or something! And I didn’t
get onto it for ages; not until I saw you trying not
to explode! How’d you work it?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t hard,” said Blash with restored complacency.
“I just told the fellow who runs the
theatre, McCready, a very decent sort of chap, that
I wanted to spring a harmless joke on one of the
fellows. Let him in on it enough so’s he’d appreciate
the stunt. Then I slipped a couple of dollars
to the guy who operates the machine up there and
he faked up the title and got hold of an old film
showing an outdoor meeting of operatives at some
shoe factory or something during a Fourth of
July celebration. And, gee, it went great, didn’t
it? That is, it did if you’re sure you’re not huffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
about it, Dick. There’s no fun in a joke that goes
sour, though!”</p>

<p>“I’m not huffy, Blash. It was a bit of a jolt at
first, though! Seeing my name flash out at me
like that—was sort of startling! What I don’t
understand, though, is what—is how——”</p>

<p>“Back to your mark! Start over, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what put the idea of a—a—where
did you get that stuff about my being a hero and
all that?” floundered Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, one hears things,” Blash chuckled. “Fame
has its—ah—penalties!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess one does hear things,” said Dick
bitterly with a resentful glance at the dimly seen
form of Stanley, ahead.</p>

<p>They dropped Blash at Goss and went on to
Sohmer, Rusty choosing the longest way home for
the privilege of enjoying their society, as he explained.
Blash’s joke was further discussed,
Rusty declaring with a reminiscent laugh that he
would never forget the expression on Dick’s face
when the title was flashed on the screen! Then
Rusty took himself off across the turf on a shortcut
to Maple Street and Dick and Stanley climbed
the stairs in silence to Number 14.</p>

<p>When the light was going Stanley looked questioningly
at his chum. “What’s the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Dick?” he asked. “Did that business jar you too
much?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t mind it, thanks,” replied Dick,
rather stiffly. “Of course,” he added after a
pause, “everyone in school will think me an awful
ass, but I suppose that won’t matter. It won’t to
you, anyway!”</p>

<p>“Just what does that mean? Why to me?”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t, will it?” asked Dick defiantly.
“If it had you’d have kept your mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“Meaning you promised to and you didn’t. You
had to go and tell Blash.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it!” Stanley sounded relieved.
“Well, let me tell you that I haven’t spoken a word
to Blash or to anyone else about that business.
I thought you had, though.”</p>

<p>“I’d be likely to!” Dick looked incredulous.
“If you didn’t, how did Blash know?”</p>

<p>“Search me, Dick. Maybe he doesn’t know.
Maybe he just hit on that by chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. Perhaps he saw that thing
in the <cite>Sentinel</cite>—But he couldn’t! Well, I’m sorry
I suspected you, Stan.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” replied the other cheerfully.
“And look here, don’t get worried over
the fellows hearing about it. Of course they will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and of course they’ll rag you a bit, but it’s only a
good joke, Dick, and that’s all they’ll think it. It
isn’t a patch on the things some fellows have had
to stand!”</p>

<p>“N-no, I suppose it isn’t. But—did you hear
one idiot there tonight ask how much I paid for
it? Maybe they’ll think I did pay for it, Stan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! That guy was just having some fun
with you. They all know it was a joke, and they
saw Rusty and Blash with us, and they’ll lay it to
one of them. As a matter of fact, Dick, it’s a
pretty good sign to have something like that
sprung on you, because it means that you <em>are</em>
somebody. If fellows don’t like you they don’t
trouble to work practical jokes on you, old top!
There’s that satisfaction if you want it!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>TWO SCRAPS OF PAPER</small></h2>


<p>Time seemed to fly that next week. Sunday vanished
almost before Dick knew it was there, and he
scarcely found time to write his letters, one to his
father and one to Sumner White. The latter was
rather a difficult missive, for he couldn’t manage
to get all the cordiality into it that he thought
Sumner would expect to find. The words looked
all right, but they sounded insincere. Then Monday
fled quickly, the afternoon occupied with much
hard work on the gridiron for the second-string
players and a light warming-up for those who
had borne the brunt of the battle against Chancellor.
Tuesday brought everyone back into
strenuous practice and the afternoon was given
over to trying out five new plays against the Second
and to a grilling signal drill. The evening
sessions continued as well. Mass meetings became
almost nightly occurrences and Parkinson
sang and yelled and became daily more enthusiastic
and more filled with football spirit. Every
line of news or rumour from Kenwood was avidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
read and discussed and the tide of patriotism ran
high. Wednesday noon brought another epistle
from Sumner White, a brief and rather chaotic
note which was as follows:</p>

<p>“Don’t pay any attention to the Whitworth
game. We weren’t out to win and we saved our
best men for Thursday. At that the score wasn’t
bad and Whitworth wouldn’t have scored the second
touchdown if we hadn’t had most of our subs
in. Well, it’s all settled for next Friday. Charlie
and Will and Jim are coming, and one other.
That’s five of us. Theo can’t go. His mother’s
sick. Went to the hospital today. And Townsend’s
backed out. Some of the girls are crazy to
go, but of course they can’t. Everything lovely
here. We’re going to win on Thanksgiving, that’s
final, Dick. Well, see you Saturday, old scout.
So long. Sum.”</p>

<p>Dick wondered who the “one other” might be
and why Sumner hadn’t told, but the question
didn’t occupy his thoughts long. He read that letter
to Stanley, watching ferociously for any sign
of levity, and was a bit disappointed when he saw
none. He was in a mood to have welcomed a
scrap!</p>

<p>That afternoon he and Stone alternated at driving
the big team against the Second in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
scrimmage before the final game, and it proved to
be the hardest and most blood-thirsty encounter
of the season. The Second, with nothing to lose,
was resolved to finish in a blaze of glory, and the
way they went at the enemy was a marvel. Before
scrimmage and after it they might be friends and
well-wishers, but while the battle was on friendship
was at an end and they fought like wild-cats.
They scored in the first ten minutes, pushing
straight through the First’s line for a clean touchdown
and kicking a goal afterwards, and they
scored again from the field within twenty seconds
of the final whistle. And the best the First could
do in retaliation was to get two touchdowns without
goals. So the score at the end was 12-10 and
the Second viewed the result as a nominal victory
and ended the training season in a condition of
wild triumph, parading around the field, singing
and cheering, to their own delight and the amused
approval of the school at large.</p>

<p>Dick emerged from the fracas with a damaged
nose and several painful but unimportant contusions,
and scarcely anyone else fared much better.
The Second Team players were tattered and disfigured
and gloried in their wounds. Altogether,
it was a disreputable and motley bunch of vagabonds
that gathered in the locker room after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
trouble was over, and, having buried the hatchet,
discussed the late unpleasantness in all its details
and speculated as to its bearing on the big game.
The coaches, for Mr. Driscoll had been assisted by
two and sometimes three enthusiastic graduates
during the past week, wore expressions of satisfaction,
just such expressions, as “Short” Davis,
confided to Dick, as the spectators doubtless wore
in ancient Rome after a particularly gory entertainment
in the arena! Dick accidentally heard
one of the assistant coaches confide to another that
“whether those chaps can lick Kenwood or not,
Perry, they sure can fight!”</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the fighting mood remained
with Dick after he had washed away the stains
of battle and was on his way across to Sohmer in
the deepening twilight. At all events, the theory
serves as an explanation of what happened when,
just outside the hall, Sandy Halden and another
fellow encountered the returning gladiator.</p>

<p>“Behold the world-famed athlete!” declaimed
Sandy, adding a laugh that was far more annoying
than the words. His companion laughed, too, but
somewhat embarrassedly. Dick scowled and
pushed past toward the steps. But Sandy wasn’t
through. “Hicksville’s Hero!” he went on grandiloquently.
“He says so himself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>What happened then was performed so quickly
that Dick was nearly as surprised as Sandy.
Sandy was prone on the grass well beyond the
edge of the walk, his companion was a dozen yards
away in flight and Dick was standing supreme on
the first step at the entrance. Presumably Dick
had pitched Sandy where he lay, but Dick had little
recollection of having done so. Or of having regained
the steps afterward. He had given way to
a sudden and overmastering anger and had acted
without conscious thought. Now, however, the
anger was gone and in its place was a wholesome
amusement.</p>

<p>“Better get off the grass, Halden,” he volunteered
cheerfully. “That’s just been seeded
there.”</p>

<p>Halden got off, but he didn’t resent the attack.
Instead, he brushed himself silently and unnecessarily,
avoiding a glance at Dick until he straightened
up again. Then with a look so malevolent
that Dick wondered at it, he said in a low voice
that shook with passion: “All right, Bates!
That settles you!”</p>

<p>Dick laughed, but not with much amusement.
Somehow, the threat conveyed in the other’s tone
precluded amusement, even though, as Dick reasoned
a moment later, Halden had no power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
harm him. Sandy turned and rejoined his waiting
but discreet companion and went his way without
further notice of his assailant. Dick, already
ashamed of his fit of temper, went on upstairs.
Fortunately, perhaps, none had seen the swift incident,
and he was very glad of it. He didn’t say
anything about it to Stanley although that youth
was doubled up on the window-seat reading.</p>

<p>Dick had heard a good many gibes, generally
good-natured, about his “heroism” and athletic
fame, for the story of the happening at the movie
house Saturday night had swiftly gone the rounds
of the school, and had shown no resentment until
Sandy Halden’s taunt. He had meant to keep his
temper under any provocation, for the best way
to banish ridicule is to laugh at it, but Sandy
had somehow managed to touch him on the raw.
Perhaps had he been less tired and less sore he
would have treated Sandy’s taunt with the same
smiling insouciance with which he had accepted
others. For some undefined reason the incident
bothered him all the rest of the evening, even during
the blackboard lecture in the Trophy Room
when his thoughts ought to have been given entirely
to Coach Driscoll’s expositions. Afterwards
he viewed that uneasiness as a premonition.</p>

<p>It was at eleven on Thursday that the blow fell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
A hurry call led him from a Latin recitation to
Coach Driscoll in the gymnasium office. The
coach looked unusually solemn, Dick thought, as
he pushed open the door and entered. Mr. Tasser,
the physical director, was there as well, but he
went out immediately, leaving his room to the
coach and Dick.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Bates,” began Mr. Driscoll. “I’ve
got rather an unpleasant matter to discuss, my
boy.” He took a long white envelope from a
pocket and from it produced two pieces of paper
which he handed to Dick. “Ever see those before,
Bates?” he asked.</p>

<p>Dick accepted them wonderingly. One was a
fragment of letter paper, much creased, the other
the lower right hand corner of an envelope,
roughly matching the scrap of letter paper in
shape, suggesting that the latter had been in the
envelope when torn and that both had subsequently
been crumpled up together. The fragment
of envelope bore the words:</p>

<div class="env">
<p class="right">ood Academy,<br />
Kenwood,<br />
Mass.</p>
</div>

<p>The envelope had been torn in such manner that
the name of the addressee was lacking. Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
studied the two fragments in puzzlement. Then
he handed them back.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen this before, sir,” he answered. “It’s
the corner of a letter I wrote and didn’t send.
This piece of envelope doesn’t belong with it. The
writing is not mine and I never saw it before.”</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll shot a sharp glance at the boy
which Dick met unflinchingly. “You’re quite certain
of that, Bates?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Quite, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll looked thoughtfully at the fragments
in his hand. “These have every appearance
of belonging together,” he objected. “You say,
however, that this is not your writing on the envelope.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it isn’t,” answered Dick positively.
“You can see the difference yourself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but frequently one unconsciously
alters the appearance of his writing when addressing
a letter. One uses rather more care in an
effort toward legibility, Bates. At least, the two
writings are much alike, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, in a general way. But I never make
a capital K like that. I don’t think I could. And
the A isn’t much like mine either.”</p>

<p>“I see. Now in this letter, Bates, there seems
to have been a good deal about football. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
bottom here I read: ‘call this the Two-Over and
use it only when other fellow is playing his backs
well out.’ That refers, I presume, to the tackle-and-half-over
play that we’ve been using in practice
lately.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who were you writing to Bates?”</p>

<p>“Sumner White, sir. He’s captain of our high
school team at home.”</p>

<p>“And home is somewhere in Pennsylvania?”</p>

<p>“Leonardville. You see——”</p>

<p>“One moment, please, Bates. Have you been in
the habit of writing to this fellow White about our
plays?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not exactly. He asked me when I came
away to tell him about anything new that he could
use. There wasn’t much, though. I explained our
defence for the ‘big shift’ and told him about a
lateral pass and about this ‘two-over.’ I guess
that’s all, sir. I suppose I shouldn’t have done it,
but it never occurred to me that there was any
harm in it. You see, Mr. Driscoll, the coach at
home isn’t much. He doesn’t know about new
stuff, and he just pegs away at the things folks
used five years ago. And the teams we play—I
mean that the High School plays—are pretty up-to-date.
So I tried to help the fellows by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
them about anything I learned here that might be
useful. I—I guess I oughtn’t to have, though.”</p>

<p>“No, you ought not to have done that, Bates,”
agreed the coach gravely. “You see, you never
can tell where a secret is going to land. It would
seem safe to say that Kenwood would pay no
attention to anything going on in a place like
Leonardville, away off in Pennsylvania; would
never hear of it. But suppose, for instance, some
fellow in your town had a friend at Kenwood and
wrote him that the local high school had a pretty
nifty play and sent him a diagram of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure there isn’t any fellow in Leonardville,
though, like that, Mr. Driscoll.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying there is. I’m only giving you
an example of the way secrets get around. There
are other ways in which that ‘two-over’ play might
reach Kenwood. A newspaper writer might explain
it in an account of a game, for instance. It
isn’t safe to even write about such things in your
letters home, Bates. I didn’t caution you or any
of the players, for I supposed you’d realise that
what goes on in practice is a secret and not to be
spoken of off the field. When was this letter
written?”</p>

<p>Dick thought hard a moment. “About two
weeks ago, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it wasn’t sent. Why?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t finished when it came time to go to a
recitation and I slipped it in a book and couldn’t
find it later. So I wrote another. And then, a
couple of days afterward, I came across this one
in the book and tore it up and threw it away.”</p>

<p>“Where did you throw it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember, sir. I think, though, I
dropped it in one of the paper barrels on the
Front; maybe the one at this side of Parkinson.”</p>

<p>“Anyone see you do it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. I guess there were fellows
around.”</p>

<p>“Hm. Who do you know at Kenwood, Bates?”</p>

<p>“No one, sir.”</p>

<p>“Positive? I understand that you have corresponded
with someone there quite regularly since
you came here.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so, Mr. Driscoll. I’ve never written
a letter to Kenwood Academy in my life and I
don’t know anyone who goes there. I suppose
what happened is that the piece of my letter and
the piece of envelope happened to be found together.
Who found them, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll shook his head. “I agreed not to
bring him into it, Bates. There’s no reason why
I should. He has, I guess, no wish to appear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the rôle of a spy. He found this evidence and
handed it over to me as it was his duty to. I
wish——” He fell silent, frowning at the two
scraps of paper. Then: “Are you a rapid writer,
Bates?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not very, I guess.”</p>

<p>The coach took a pad of paper from the desk
beside him and a fountain pen from his pocket.
“Suppose you write what I tell you to on that,”
he said. Dick laid the pad on his knee and waited.
“Ready? Write ‘Massachusetts Academy Kenwood,’
please.”</p>

<p>Dick wrote and the coach accepted the result
and viewed it intently. Then he shook his head.
“Your K and your A aren’t like the others, Bates,
but there’s a certain similarity. Honestly, I don’t
know what to think. I want to believe you, my
boy, but this—this evidence is rather convincing.
Look here, can you prove to my satisfaction that
this letter was intended for this friend in
Loganville and not meant for someone at Kenwood?”</p>

<p>“Leonardville, sir. I don’t know. I can get
Sumner to write to you and say that I sent him a
letter containing what you read there, although
worded differently, probably, and some other letters
like I’ve told you. Would that do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would certainly help. Hang it, Bates, you
must see yourself that the thing looks bad!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I guess it does,” agreed Dick dispiritedly.
“All I can say is that it was done
thoughtlessly and that I’ve never had any correspondence
with Kenwood. Why should I want
to give away our plays to Kenwood, Mr. Driscoll?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Bates. You’ve worked hard and
made good and I don’t believe you’re the sort of
fellow that would do a dishonourable act. You
have been careless and thoughtless, but I’d like
mightily to believe that your account of it is right.
If you’ll wire to this fellow White——”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s coming here Saturday, sir! I just
remembered! Would it do if we waited and—and
talked to him?”</p>

<p>“Coming here? Of course it would! That’s
fine! But how does it happen that he’s coming to
Warne?”</p>

<p>Dick somewhat shamefacedly explained and the
coach smiled at his embarrassment. “Well, it
seems that you’re more of a hero than I suspected,
Bates,” he said quite in his usual manner. “I
had heard something about it, too, of late.” He
added that with a twinkle, and Dick smiled ruefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was a beastly joke of Wallace Blashington’s
sir. He—he heard somehow about—about
this and thought he’d have some fun with me.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, now, Bates, let’s see where we
stand. You produce this White chap Saturday
before the game and if he can put a quietus on
this story I’ll be satisfied. No one has heard anything
about this matter except—the fellow who
found these pieces of paper and I. And no one
will hear. I guess I’m pretty well convinced already,
my boy! Now don’t let this bother you. It
will come out all right, I’m sure. And if it does—as
it’s going to—we’re going to need your best
work the day after tomorrow. Come and see me
Saturday, Bates, and—— By the way, what time
do you expect this Mr. White?”</p>

<p>“I think he will be in on that train that gets here
at twelve-ten, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm, rather late! But that can’t be helped.
You switch him over here to me as soon as he arrives
and we’ll nail this thing right away. That’s
all, Bates. Sorry this had to come up, but as it
has I’m glad we’re going to clear it up so nicely.”
Mr. Driscoll offered his hand and Dick shook it
and went out.</p>

<p>“Of all the crazy things to do!” marvelled Stanley
when, at noon, Dick found him in the room and
poured out the story to him. “Didn’t you know
you weren’t supposed to give your plays away like
that?”</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t think,” said Dick humbly.
“Besides, Leonardville is so far away——”</p>

<p>“Well, no use talking about it now. Who do
you suppose found the letter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Most anyone might have. I
dare say I tossed the whole thing at the barrel
and this piece that Mr. Driscoll has fell outside.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s probably what happened. But
where did the bit of envelope come from? I don’t
believe that was any accident, Dick!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Dick warmly.
“Do you think I lied——”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses! What I mean is that—well,
I don’t know just what I do mean, Dickie. But if
anyone had found that piece of your letter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
wanted to get you in wrong all he’d have had to
do was——”</p>

<p>“I thought of that, Stan, but there isn’t anyone
who——”</p>

<p>Dick stopped and frowned thoughtfully at his
chum.</p>

<p>“Sure of that?” asked Stanley.</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“Yes, how about Sandy? He has it in for you,
hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose he has. In fact, he’s got a
good big mad on with me, Stan. I didn’t tell you,
but I had a bit of an argument with him yesterday
afternoon, down in front of the door. Do you
think——”</p>

<p>“What sort of an argument?” asked Stanley
suspiciously.</p>

<p>So Dick told and Stanley snapped his fingers in
triumph. “Why, it’s as plain as the nose on your
face, Dick!” he exclaimed. “Either Sandy came
across that piece of paper by accident or he saw
you tear the letter up and pulled it out after you’d
gone on. Then, yesterday, he fixed up that envelope
to look as if it belonged with the letter!
You didn’t ask Mr. Driscoll when he got them,
did you? Well, I’ll wager it was last night after
you’d thrown Sandy down or early this morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
It’s a mean thing to say, Dickie, but the thing’s
just the sort of low-down plot that Sandy would
take to. Shows ingenuity, too, and Sandy’s no fool
if he is a villain! Why don’t you put it up to
Driscoll straight! Tell him you know who supplied
the incriminating evidence and tell him the
whole yarn.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t prove anything, Stan.”</p>

<p>“What of it? You can show that Sandy has a
grouch and Driscoll’s got sense enough to see that
the whole thing’s a frame-up.”</p>

<p>“I might go to Sandy and make him tell the
truth,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“How? He’d deny it, of course. Well, after all,
it’s no great matter. Driscoll doesn’t believe it
and when your Leonardville chum gets here he can
clear the whole thing up. Best thing to do is forget
it. It’s rather a sell on Sandy, though, for I
guess he expected Driscoll would fire you off the
team!”</p>

<p>“Somehow, I sort of think that’s what he meant
to do when I first went in there.”</p>

<p>“You can bet he didn’t want to, Dick! He’d
have done it, though, in a minute, if he hadn’t
believed your story! Say, if I was you I’d take a
crack at Sandy, just for luck, the first time I met
him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dick didn’t do that. For one reason, he
didn’t see Sandy that day or the next. He might
have found him, but Dick concluded that his hold
on the position of substitute quarter-back was uncertain
enough at present without taking any
chances! And so long as Sumner was coming to
clear up the mystery he could afford to keep the
peace.</p>

<p>That Thursday evening Dick and Stanley went
over to Goss to call on Blash and Sid. It was raining
great guns and an easterly gale was howling
around the corner as they set forth and, in violation
of a school ordinance, cut across over the
turf and under the dripping branches of the bare
lindens. Both Blash and Sid were home and hailed
the arrival of visitors with loud acclaim. Blash
pulled the “larder,” as he called it, from under
the window-seat and produced sweet crackers and
the remains of a pineapple cheese and Sid disappeared
down the corridor and presently returned
with three bottles of some sweetly sickish concoction
called Raspberry Squash. It was a quarter
of an hour later, after the last bit of cheese had
disappeared that Dick, idly prospecting among a
pile of magazines and papers—many of them
moving picture monthlies—happened on something
that brought an exclamation of surprise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
his lips. The others, busy in talk, neither heard
nor noted and Dick drew from concealment a copy
of the Leonardville <cite>Sentinel</cite>, opened with the
third page uppermost. “Leonardville is Proud of
Him,” read Dick. He didn’t go on, for he remembered
the rest of it perfectly. Instead, he laid the
paper down and thoughtfully stared across at
Blash, who was too enthralled in the conversation
to heed. Dick kept silence for a good five minutes.
Then, to the astonishment of the others, he
broke in rudely and abruptly.</p>

<p>“How did you know about my brother Stuart,
Blash?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” Blash looked across
startledly, striving to accommodate his mind to
the sudden change of subject.</p>

<p>“And where we lived?” pursued Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, what was it you asked?” Blash
floundered badly, his gaze falling on the paper
under Dick’s hand and a slow grin curving the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I asked how you knew my brother’s name and
where he lived,” explained Dick calmly; “and
where we lived.”</p>

<p>Blash looked at Dick for an instant and then
shrugged. “I didn’t, Dick,” he answered. “That
part was supplied by the editor man, I suppose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
All I did was to write a nice little press notice and
mail it to the paper. I didn’t know whether they’d
use it, but they did, and they sent me a copy of
it. Honest, now, don’t you think journalism is
my line? Dana or Bennett or any of those top-notchers
got anything on me, Dick?”</p>

<p>Stanley was staring wide-eyed. “D-do you
mean that <em>you</em> wrote that thing about Dick in the
Leonardville paper?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Most of it,” replied Blash modestly. “Of
course, as I’m telling you, I couldn’t supply the—the
intimate details.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!”</p>

<p>“Same here,” laughed Sid. “Blash, you’re as
crazy a loon as they make!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Dick, “you’ve spent most
of your time of late working practical jokes on
me. After this I’ll never believe a thing until
I’ve made sure you’re not at the bottom of it.
Well, I wonder if you know that that tommyrot
of yours here about my high school friends coming
to see Saturday’s game started something.”</p>

<p>“Started something!” Blash asked eagerly.
“No. What?”</p>

<p>“Five of the fellows read that drivel and decided
to follow the suggestion. Blash, I hope you
choke!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Blash had gone off into a gale of laughter.
Stanley and Sid grinned doubtfully, wanting to
laugh, too, but fearful of wounding Dick’s feelings.</p>

<p>“O boy!” gasped Blash. “Dick, I guess we’re
more than even! I’ve paid in full, eh?”</p>

<p>Dick smiled at last. “No, you still owe me
some pennies.”</p>

<p>“Not a cent! You telephoned me that night at
the movie house that I needn’t pay the last seven
and a half cents: or, at least, ‘Uncle John’ did!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” acknowledged Dick, laughing.
“I’d forgotten.”</p>

<p>“When you get back,” said Stanley, “you can
read what I wrote on the piece of paper one night.
Remember?”</p>

<p>Dick nodded. “Better tell me now, though. I
never could stand suspense.”</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Blash will chisel a penny in two and
send half as the last payment.’ Was I right,
Blash?”</p>

<p>“Right as rain! Fact is, the two halves are in
that top drawer over there this minute. But
you’ll never get either of them, Dick. I’ve paid
my debts!”</p>

<p>“You have,” agreed Dick heartily. “You’ve
more than paid them, and I hope I’ll live long
enough to hand you back the change!”</p>

<small>KENWOOD SCORES</small></h2>


<p>Friday was a hard day to live through. Excitement
was in the very air and football tunes assailed
one at every turn. For the players the day
was a nervous period of suspense. Dick was
heartily glad when recitations took his thoughts
off the morrow. There was some punting and a
light signal drill on the field in the afternoon, but
it was all over by half-past four. A final black-board
talk was held in the evening and after it
most of the players went over to the final mass-meeting
and sat on the stage and were wildly
cheered. Everyone who could think of anything
to say that evening said it: Mr. Morgan, Chairman
of the Athletic Committee, Coach Driscoll,
Captain Peters, Billy Goode, Manager Whipple
and one or two lesser luminaries. And the musical
clubs played and the Glee Club sang and everyone
joined in, and enthusiasm held sway until
late.</p>

<p>Saturday morning dawned brisk and fair, with a
light westerly wind sweeping along the Front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Kenwood began to appear on the scene as early as
half-past ten, and from that time on blue banners
were almost as numerous as brown-and-white
ones. The Kenwood team came at shortly after
twelve and went at once to Alumni Hall for an
early luncheon, heartily cheered on their way by
friend and foe. On the train that brought the
thirty husky warriors came also five persons
whose affiliations were evidently with Parkinson,
for each of the five wore a brown necktie, differing
somewhat in shade, and two wore brown-and-white
arm-bands. In the confusion existing in
and about the Warne station they were not discovered
by the reception committee of one for several
minutes. Then Dick gave a yell, charged
through the throng, grabbed Sumner White and
spun him around.</p>

<p>“Sum! You old scoundrel! How are you?”
Dick was surprised to discover how glad he was
to see Sumner.</p>

<p>“Fine! Gee, Dick, you’ve grown an inch! Say,
you needn’t have come to meet us. I told
your——” Sumner stopped, grinning. “See
who’s here?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Charlie! Hello, Jim! Say, I’m awfully
glad——” Dick’s words stopped in his
throat. Then: “<em>Dad!</em>” he gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bates laughed a trifle embarrassedly as he
took Dick’s hand in both of his own. “Yes, it’s
me, Dick. I—I thought I’d come along and keep
these young fellows in order, you know. Well,
how are you, son?”</p>

<p>“I’m great,” answered Dick, “but I’m so
knocked in a heap—Think of you coming, dad!
Gee, I’m glad to see you! How are you? Let’s
get out of here where we can talk.” Dick took
his father’s arm and piloted him out to the sidewalk.
Taxicabs were not to be thought of, for
the demand already exceeded the supply six to
one, and so they set off along the street afoot,
Dick talking and asking questions and all the
others chiming in every minute. It wasn’t until
they were crossing the campus, Dick pointing out
the sights, that he remembered the appointment
with Mr. Driscoll. Then he hurried them all to
the room in Sohmer and left them in charge of
Stanley while he and Sumner went on to the gymnasium.
On the way Dick explained the situation
to his companion, perhaps not very lucidly, and
Sumner was still in a most confused condition of
mind when he faced the coach. But it didn’t matter,
for Mr. Driscoll’s questions were few and
somewhat perfunctory after Dick had had his say
about Sandy Halden. “I think, sir,” Dick ended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
“that Halden didn’t find that piece of an envelope
at all. I think he addressed it himself, copying
my writing the best he could.”</p>

<p>“And I think you’re right,” agreed Mr. Driscoll.
“I’ll have something to say to Halden after
this game’s out of the way. He’s a dangerous fellow
to have around.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were back in Number 14,
in the midst of a merry din of talk and laughter.
Dick couldn’t remain with them long, however, for
luncheon for the players was at a quarter to one,
or as soon as the Kenwood party vacated the dining
hall, and so, giving the tickets he had obtained
for them to Sumner, he hurried away. “Stan will
look after you,” he shouted back from the door.
“There’s a stand-up lunch in Alumni for visitors
at one-thirty, or you can get real food in the village.
Stan will take you over to the field in
plenty of time and I’ll see you here after the
game. So long, dad! So long, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Dick!” cried Sumner. “Eat ’em up,
old scout! We’ll be rooting for you!”</p>

<p>A sketchy luncheon in the dining hall, with no
one eating much, not even the veterans like Bob
Peters and Harry Warden, a flight by way of the
service entrance to the gymnasium and the usual
confusion of changing to playing togs and listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to final instructions at the same time. Then,
at last, just before two o’clock, a heartening, quiet
talk of a minute by the coach.</p>

<p>Kenwood was already at practice when Parkinson
reached the field. The home stand arose and
gave the “long cheer” and the base drummer of
the Warne Silver Cornet Band thumped vigorously.
Counter cheers mingled from across the
field and then the visitors cheered for Parkinson,
and Captain Bob led his men forth and a ten-minute
warming-up followed, with three squads
trotting up and down and the punters stretching
their long legs down by the east goal. It was
four minutes past two when the teams took their
places and the din of cheering and singing subsided.</p>

<p>In seats half-way up the centre of the south
stands Mr. Bates and Sumner White and the other
three visitors from Leonardville watched intently.
Sumner had just discovered that Dick was not in
the Brown-and-White’s line-up and had proclaimed
the fact disappointedly.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” asked Mr. Bates anxiously.
“Isn’t he going to play, Sumner?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” replied Sumner, assuming more
confidence than he felt. “You see, a quarter-back
doesn’t often last a whole game. It’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
pretty hard job. So they generally put in one
to start the game and then run the other fellow
on later. I guess Dick will get in before the half’s
over, Mr. Bates. I think I see him down there
on the bench. Yes, there he is, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bates had to have his son pointed out to
him, and then a shrill whistle blew and Kenwood,
having lost the toss, kicked the ball high and far
into the sunlight.</p>

<p>For the first ten minutes of that game Parkinson
and Kenwood tried each other out and neither
team approached a score. Kenwood had what advantage
lay in a mild westerly breeze and she
punted often. But if she expected fumbles or misjudgments
she was disappointed, for either Stone
or Warden caught unfailingly and usually took
the ball back over one or two white lines before
being stopped. Just at first Mr. Bates, whose
football education had been sadly neglected,
thought the game much too rough and predicted
broken legs and worse, but before that first quarter
was at an end he was inured to the ungentle
behaviour of the contestants and was following
the varying fortunes of the game with grim lips
and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Parkinson made one first down and Kenwood
two in the initial period, the second of the Blue’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
successes coming just at the end when a back
shot unexpectedly around Peters’ end and made
all of seven yards before he was pulled to earth
and enthusiastically sat on by most of the Parkinson
team! Two attacks on Newhall and Wendell
added the three more and the chain was trailed to
a new position. But the Blue was still well away
from the home team’s goal and shortly after the
second quarter began she had to punt again.</p>

<p>Neither team appeared to be able to gain consistently
through the opposing line, while neither
team had shown thus far much ability to run
the ends. It looked like a punting duel all the
way, with the victory depending on a “break” in
the defence of one side or the other. It was a ding-dong
affair for thirty minutes of playing time,
and when the first half ended neither team could
claim the advantage.</p>

<p>“You wait till Dick gets in, though,” said Sumner
to Mr. Bates when the field had emptied and
the Silver Cornet Band was blaring forth again.
“That quarter they’ve had playing may be good,
but I’ll bet Dick can play all around him. He’s
awfully slow, for one thing——”</p>

<p>“Dick is?” inquired Mr. Bates, anxious to
learn football lore.</p>

<p>“No, that fellow Stone. Dick’s a streak when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
he gets started. Why, he can do the hundred in
ten and two-fifths, sir!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” murmured Mr. Bates. He
wondered what the hundred was and how Dick
“did” it, but he had no intention of exhibiting his
ignorance any further. He was still recalling
Sumner’s expression when he had innocently
asked which team the little man in the grey flannel
trousers—he happened to be the umpire—played
on!</p>

<p>Stone, however, was still in the line-up when the
third period began and Dick was anxiously looking
on from the bench, one of some fifteen other equally
anxious substitutes. It was when the last half was
but four minutes old that Kenwood sprung her
big surprise. The surprise was a tow-headed
youngster who had been substituted at right half.
Someone near the Leonardville contingent said
his name was Marvel, and Sumner declared heartily
that he was well-named. The next day’s papers
called him Marble, which was probably correct
but not nearly so descriptive. Marble was the
nearest imitation of an eel that the Parkinson
team had ever had to contend with. Kenwood
played him close to the line, gave him the ball on
a direct pass from centre and then set him loose.
After he was loose he was about as easy to locate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
as a flea, and, having been located, about as easy
as a flea to capture! His first stunt, and one that
brought the visiting rooters to their feet with a
sudden fierce and triumphant yell and sent Parkinson
hearts into Parkinson boots, was a dash
through the brown-and-white line outside left
tackle. He went through much as a hot knife
cleaves its way through butter, and after he was
through he feinted and squirmed and doubled and
twisted until only Stone stood between him and
the Parkinson goal. And Stone missed him!</p>

<p>That forty-seven-yard run that ended in a touchdown
squarely between the posts was just the
medicine Parkinson needed, however, and with the
score seven to naught against her, for Kenwood
couldn’t have missed that goal with a blind and
one-legged kicker, she set to work with a new
determination and a new vim. Stone remained
in just two plays after the kick-off. Then, not a
little groggy, he limped off, loyally cheered, and
Dick took his place.</p>

<p>Dick carried but one instruction with him.
“Hustle your team, Bates,” Mr. Driscoll had said
quietly.</p>

<p>With the coach’s encouraging thump on his
shoulder to remember and the knowledge that his
father and Sumner and the others were wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
him luck, Dick raced on with every nerve tingling
and a big, hot desire in his heart to vindicate
their faith in him. Bob Peters hailed him joyfully.
Bob was as happy as a clam, despite an ensanguined
nose. “Ata boy, Dick!” he sang out as
Dick came up. “Look who’s here, fellows! What
do you say?”</p>

<p>The others said many things, somewhat breathlessly
but heartily, and Dick hurried back to his
position the instant he had reported. “All right
now, Parkinson!” he cried cheerfully. “Let’s see
what we can do when we <em>try</em>! Every fellow on his
toes and play fast! You’ve been asleep, every one
of you! Let’s have some action. Let’s show ’em
the game!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>QUARTER-BACK BATES</small></h2>


<p>The ball was still Kenwood’s on her forty-six
and she had made five yards in two downs. Another
thrust added a yard more. Then came a
forward-pass, and Peters spoiled it while brown-and-white
banners waved. Dick came running in,
piping his signals on the way.</p>

<p>Then started one of those long and steady
marches down the field that, while less thrilling,
less spectacular than runs or passes, are far more
gruelling. If Parkinson had played slowly before
she played so no longer. Never on that field had
plays been run off faster, never had backs started
quicker or linemen lunged harder. The pace told
on the enemy before the thirty-yard line was
passed. Dick chose his plays wisely, uncannily,
thrusting here and there unexpectedly, trying this
end and that and always somehow managing to get
his ten yards in four downs. Sometimes the distance
had to be measured and often the result was
in doubt until the referee’s hand waved to the
chain holders, but from the enemy’s forty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to her eight the advance continued remorselessly.
Kirkendall and Warden were the heroes of that
invasion, although Gaines and Peters, the latter
twice sweeping around from position for short
gains, took part as well. But on the eight yards
Kenwood dug her toes and refused to give another
inch. On the second down Kirkendall was doubled
up for no gain, after Warden had failed off right
tackle, and the big full-back was sent to the eighteen
yards for a try-at-goal. But there was an attempted
double pass first, and if Gaines had taken
the throw from Dick in better shape it might have
come off. As it was, however, Gaines almost
dropped the ball, recovered it and was downed before
he could toss across the line to the expectant
Bob Peters. So, after all, that march tallied but
three points for the Brown-and-White, and came
near to not tallying at all, for Kenwood found
a weak spot on the Parkinson right and plunged
through desperately as Kirkendall booted. The
pigskin cleared the upstretched hands by inches
only, but cleared them and sailed safely over the
bar.</p>

<p>Parkinson cheered and demanded further
scores, but the third quarter ended in an exchange
of punts after the kick-off and when the final
period began the score was 7-3, with Parkinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
on the short end and, so many thought, likely to
stay there.</p>

<p>Coach Driscoll put in a new right guard and a
new right tackle, Bartlett and Cairns, so bolstering
what, all the season, had shown as the weakest
part of the brown-and-white line. Scoville also
went in, Furniss having played himself to a stand-still
at left end.</p>

<p>Kenwood started from her twenty-nine yards
when the period began and unloosed Marble again
for a fifteen-yard romp, and again got him loose
for twelve more, taking the ball well into Parkinson
territory. Then two plunges failed and a forward-pass
went wrong and the visitors punted to
Dick on his twelve. A Kenwood end upset him
before he had gained his speed. Parkinson started
another march then, but it went less smoothly
now and ended at her thirty-five, and Kirkendall
punted. Kenwood returned on second down, losing
several yards on the exchange. Again Parkinson
took up her weary advance, but the plunges
at the enemy line netted shorter gains and it was a
forward-pass, Dick to Peters that took the home
team to the enemy’s twenty-two yards. Here an
attempt by Gaines around his own left was nipped
in the bud. A penalty for holding set the Brown-and-White
still further back and again she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
punted. Kenwood once more accepted the challenge
and Warden caught near the boundary on
his thirty-eight.</p>

<p>Kenwood began to make substitutions in earnest
and Coach Driscoll called Gaines out and sent
Long in. Many of the Parkinson team were showing
the effects of the game by now and Bob Peters,
though still confident and cheerful, looked like a
wreck. Dick tried to persuade him to go off, but
Bob indignantly spurned the notion. Time was
flying fast and something less than six minutes
remained when Parkinson lined up near the edge
of the field on her thirty-eight. Long got two
through the Kenwood centre and lost it on a second
attempt at the same place. Dick ran half
across the field for a scant three yards and Kirkendall
romped around his own right for eight. Then
another forward failed, for Scoville was far out
of position for the catch, and Warden was knifed
through the Kenwood left for two. With eight to
go on third down, Kirkendall faked a kick and
threw a short pass across the centre of the line
which Peters just missed, and Kenwood took the
ball.</p>

<p>Four minutes only remained and Kenwood tried
every known method of wasting time. In the end,
though, she was forced to punt, for Marble was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
stopped twice—the youngster had been used hard
and was showing the result—and the pigskin was
Parkinson’s on her forty-one. Kirkendall was
pulled down for a loss and had to go out, and
Trask, who took his place, made but a yard outside
right tackle. Long skirted the enemy left for
seven, however, and then made it first down on
a plucky slam straight at centre. But it was hopeless
to expect to snatch a victory by such slow
methods, for the hands of the timekeeper’s watch
were ticking off the seconds fast. Dick tried a forward,
Trask to Peters, but Kenwood was not to
be fooled and Bob never had a chance at the
hurtling ball. The “two-over” netted four where
the Kenwood line split to meet the shift. Dick
tried the same play again on the opposite side and
got three. Warden was hurt and gave way to
Skinner. Trask punted to Kenwood’s seven and
the fleet-footed and elusive Marble caught and
brought the pigskin back to twenty-three, through
the whole Parkinson team. Twice Kenwood dared
to buck the brown-and-white line and then punted
to safety.</p>

<p>But what seemed safety was not. For Dick
made the catch on his twenty-eight yards, and for
once the interference was all he could have asked
for. Skinner and Peters upset the Kenwood ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and a hastily formed cordon of Parkinson players
blocked the others. Dick looked and whirled to
the left, cutting diagonally across behind his interference.
Then he had to side-step an eager
Kenwood tackle, and after that to run his hardest
to throw off the Blue’s right half. But he did it,
for he had found his stride now and that ability of
which Sumner White had boasted to Dick’s father
came to his aid. Straight along the side-line he
flew, some five yards inside it, hard and fast, with
the enemy speeding after him and the quarter-back
coming down upon him. The fifty-yard-line went
underfoot and the pursuit had not gained. But
the enemy quarter was almost on him now. Dick
eased his pace the littlest bit and veered further
into the field. Whatever happened, he did not
mean to be forced over the side-line. Not until he
had passed the middle of the field did the thought
that he might win the victory for Parkinson come
to him. Until then he had thought only of getting
free, of gaining what he might before he was
thrown to the turf. Now, though, with only the
quarter-back before him he caught a brief and
wonderful glimpse of victory! If only he could
get by the last of the enemy!</p>

<p>Then it happened, almost before he was ready
to meet it! The Kenwood player poised, waited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
sprang! Dick whirled on his heel, his right arm
stretched before him, locked, and spun dizzily.
Arms grasped his thighs, were torn loose, settled
about his knees, held! Dick felt despair at his
heart even as he strove to wrench free, to set
his feet in new strides. And somehow, his hand
thrusting at a head and his knees tugging at the
bonds that held them together, he staggered free!
Staggered and fell to one knee and one hand, but
found his feet beneath him again and the goal
beckoning!</p>

<p><a href="#image04">The pursuit had closed in now and foremost
friend and enemy were but a few yards behind</a>,
but Dick’s speed was still to be counted on and,
although his lungs hurt and his legs felt leaden,
he gained at every stride and sped on and on over
one white line after another. Behind him panting
players surged despairingly or joyously and beside
him a thunderous surge of shouts and a wild
din of cheers kept pace. Then the end was in
sight. Here was the ten-yard-line beneath his feet,
there the last trampled yellow-white mark and the
padded posts of the goal! Only a few more
strides, only a few more agonising gasps for
breath!</p>

<p>Dick never knew when he actually crossed the
line, never knew when, having crossed it, he circled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the nearer post and dropped weakly to the earth to
be pounced on as weakly by a Kenwood back.
When he did know things clearly the world was a
medley of triumphant shouting and the blaring of
instruments and the thump-thumping of a bass
drum. He was still fighting for breath when Trask
kicked the goal that put the score at 10-7. And
10-7 it stayed, for there was only time for an
exchange of punts and a discouraged rush by Kenwood
when the whistle signalled the end of the
game and the end of the season, the victory of
Parkinson and the defeat of a worthy foe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later Dick sat in state in Number 14
Sohmer and received the congratulations of his
friends. His father sat beside him, very proud
and erect, beaming on all; on Blash and Rusty and
Sid and Stanley and many more who stormed the
hero’s retreat that November afternoon. And
there let us leave him, with Blash’s words in our
ears: “Two dozen citizens,” declaimed Blash, “in
monster indoor meeting pay tribute to famous
athlete, Richard Corliss Bates!”</p>

Slade through a series of typical boy adventures through
his tenderfoot days as a scout, through his gallant days as
an American doughboy in France, back to his old patrol
and the old camp ground at Black Lake, and so on.</p>

the very essence of Boy life. He is a real boy, as real as
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. He is the moving spirit of
the troop of Scouts of which he is a member, and the average
boy has to go only a little way in the first book before
Roy is the best friend he ever had, and he is willing to part
with his best treasure to get the next book in the series.</p>

<p>All readers of the Tom Slade and the Roy Blakeley
books are acquainted with Pee-wee Harris. These stories
record the true facts concerning his size (what there is of
it) and his heroism (such as it is), his voice, his clothes,
his appetite, his friends, his enemies, his victims. Together
with the thrilling narrative of how he foiled, baffled, circumvented
and triumphed over everything and everybody
(except where he failed) and how even when he failed he
succeeded. The whole recorded in a series of screams and
told with neither muffler nor cut-out.</p>

<p>Westy Martin, known to every friend of
Roy Blakeley, appears as the hero of adventures
quite different from those in which we
have seen him participate as a Scout of
Bridgeboro and of Temple Camp. On his
way to the Yellowstone the bigness of the vast
West and the thoughts of the wild preserve
that he is going to visit make him conscious of
his own smallness and of the futility of “boy
scouting” and woods lore in this great region.
Yet he was to learn that if it had not been for
his scout training he would never have been
able to survive the experiences he had in these
stories.</p>
